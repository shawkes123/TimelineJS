                  "text": "<p> Mr. Comey owes his job and his reputation to the night in 2004 when he rushed to the Washington hospital room of John Ashcroft, the attorney general, and prevented Bush administration officials from persuading him to reauthorize a classified program that had been ruled unconstitutional. At the time, Mr. Comey, a Republican, was the deputy attorney general.\n\nYears later, when Mr. Obama was looking for a new F.B.I. director, Mr. Comey seemed an inspired bipartisan choice. But his style eventually grated on his bosses at the Justice Department.\n\nIn 2015, as prosecutors pushed for greater accountability for police misconduct, Mr. Comey embraced the controversial theory that scrutiny of police officers led to increases in crime — the so-called Ferguson effect. “We were really caught off guard,” said Vanita Gupta, the Justice Department’s top civil rights prosecutor at the time. “He lobbed a fairly inflammatory statement, without data to back it up, and walked away.”\n\nOn other issues, Mr. Comey bucked the administration but won praise from his agents, who saw him as someone who did what he believed was right, regardless of the political ramifications.\n\n“Jim sees his role as apolitical and independent,” said Daniel C. Richman, a longtime confidant and friend of Mr. Comey’s. “The F.B.I. director, even as he reports to the attorney general, often has to stand apart from his boss.”\n\nThe F.B.I.’s involvement with Mrs. Clinton’s emails began in July 2015 when it received a letter from the inspector general for the intelligence community.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe letter said that classified information had been found on Mrs. Clinton’s home email server, which she had used as secretary of state. The secret email setup was already proving to be a damaging issue in her presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Comey’s deputies quickly concluded that there was reasonable evidence that a crime may have occurred in the way classified materials were handled, and that the F.B.I. had to investigate. “We knew as an organization that we didn’t have a choice,” said John Giacalone, a former mob investigator who had risen to become the F.B.I.’s top national security official.\n\nOn July 10, 2015, the F.B.I. opened a criminal investigation, code-named “Midyear,” into Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information. The Midyear team included two dozen investigators led by a senior analyst and by an experienced F.B.I. supervisor, Peter Strzok, a former Army officer who had worked on some of the most secretive investigations in recent years involving Russian and Chinese espionage.\n\nThere was controversy almost immediately.\n\nResponding to questions from The Times, the Justice Department confirmed that it had received a criminal referral — the first step toward a criminal investigation — over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information.\n\nBut the next morning, the department revised its statement.\n\n“The department has received a referral related to the potential compromise of classified information,” the new statement read. “It is not a criminal referral.”\n\nAt the F.B.I., this was a distinction without a difference: Despite what officials said in public, agents had been alerted to mishandled classified information and in response, records show, had opened a full criminal investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department knew a criminal investigation was underway, but officials said they were being technically accurate about the nature of the referral. Some at the F.B.I. suspected that Democratic appointees were playing semantic games to help Mrs. Clinton, who immediately seized on the statement to play down the issue. “It is not a criminal investigation,” she said, incorrectly. “It is a security review.”\n\nIn September of that year, as Mr. Comey prepared for his first public questions about the case at congressional hearings and press briefings, he went across the street to the Justice Department to meet with Ms. Lynch and her staff.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth had been federal prosecutors in New York — Mr. Comey in the Manhattan limelight, Ms. Lynch in the lower-wattage Brooklyn office. The 6-foot-8 Mr. Comey commanded a room and the spotlight. Ms. Lynch, 5 feet tall, was known for being cautious and relentlessly on message. In her five months as attorney general, she had shown no sign of changing her style.\n\nAt the meeting, everyone agreed that Mr. Comey should not reveal details about the Clinton investigation. But Ms. Lynch told him to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a “matter.”\n\nMs. Lynch reasoned that the word “investigation” would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations.\n\nIt was a by-the-book decision. But Mr. Comey and other F.B.I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward.\n\nAs the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. “I guess you’re the Federal Bureau of Matters now,” Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there.\n\nDespite his concerns, Mr. Comey avoided calling it an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Mr. Comey told reporters days after the meeting.\n\nThe F.B.I. investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email server was the biggest political story in the country in the fall of 2015. But something much bigger was happening in Washington. And nobody recognized it.\n\nWhile agents were investigating Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic National Committee’s computer system was compromised. It appeared to have been the work of Russian hackers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe significance of this moment is obvious now, but it did not immediately cause alarm at the F.B.I. or the Justice Department.\n\nOver the previous year, dozens of think tanks, universities and political organizations associated with both parties had fallen prey to Russian spear phishing — emails that tricked victims into clicking on malicious links. The D.N.C. intrusion was a concern, but no more than the others.\n\nMonths passed before the D.N.C. and the F.B.I. met to address the hacks. And it would take more than a year for the government to conclude that the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had an audacious plan to steer the outcome of an American election.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>FBI Director James B. Comey overstated key findings involving the Hillary Clinton email investigation during testimony to Congress last week, according to people close to the inquiry.\n\nIn defending the probe, Comey offered seemingly new details to underscore the seriousness of the situation FBI agents faced last fall when they discovered thousands of Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails on the computer of her husband, Anthony Weiner.\n\n“Somehow, her emails were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information,” Comey said, adding later, “His then-spouse Huma Abedin appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to him for him I think to print out for her so she could then deliver them to the secretary of state.”\n\n[Comey says he feels ‘mildly nauseous’ about possibility he affected election, but has no regrets]\n\nAt another point in the testimony, Comey said Abedin “forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails, some of which contain classified information.’’\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nNeither of those statements is accurate, said people close to the investigation. The inquiry found that Abedin did occasionally forward emails to her husband for printing, but it was a far smaller number than Comey described, and it wasn’t a “regular practice,” these people said. None of the forwarded emails were marked classified, but a small number — a handful, one person said — contained information that was later judged to contain classified information, these people said.\n\nJustice Department and FBI officials are considering whether and how to clarify the misstatements, said people familiar with the matter. The issue of the misstatements was first reported by ProPublica.\n\nComey spent hours testifying at the Senate hearing defending his handling of the investigation of Clinton’s use of a private server for work while she was secretary of state, saying it made him “mildly nauseous” to think he might have affected the outcome of the presidential election but insisting that he had no regrets and would not have handled it differently.\n\nComey’s handling of the Clinton inquiry has come under sustained criticism from Democrats — including Clinton — who say it was a major factor that contributed to her presidential election defeat in November to Donald Trump. On Oct. 28, less than two weeks before Election Day, the director notified Congress that new Clinton-related emails had been found on a laptop belonging to Weiner.\n\nDays later, investigators obtained a search warrant to examine about 3,000 messages on the device that were work-related. Of those, Comey said, agents found a dozen that contained classified information, but they were messages investigators had already seen.\n\nThe misstatements in testimony aren’t the first time Comey has overstated a key fact in a high-profile probe.\n\nA year ago, while speaking at a security forum in London, the director miscalculated the price the FBI had paid for a technique to crack into a locked iPhone belonging to one of the dead suspects in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey testifies on May 3 before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nAt the event, he said the cost of the phone hacking tool was “more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.’’ Based on Comey’s salary, his comment strongly implied the bureau paid at least $1.3 million to get into the phone, which belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook. Farook and his wife killed 14 people during a December 2015 terrorist attack.\n\nPeople close to that case said the FBI actually paid about $900,000.\n\nRead more:\n\nRead the full testimony of FBI Director James Comey\n\nComputer seized in Weiner probe prompts FBI to take new steps in Clinton email inquiry\n\nThe attorney general could have ordered FBI Director James Comey not to send his bombshell letter on Clinton emails.

                  "text": "<p>Mr. Comey broke with longstanding tradition and policies by publicly discussing the Clinton case last July and chastising her “careless” handling of classified information. Then, in the campaign’s final days, Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. was reopening the investigation, a move that earned him widespread criticism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet many of the facts cited as evidence for Mr. Comey’s dismissal were well known when Mr. Trump kept him on the job. Mr. Comey was three years in to a 10-year term. And both Mr. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had praised Mr. Comey back then by calling his public announcement “gutsy.” On Tuesday, that action was at the heart of Mr. Comey’s firing.\n\n“It is essential that we find new leadership for the F.B.I. that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,” Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nOfficials at the F.B.I. said they learned through news reports of Mr. Comey’s dismissal, which Mr. Trump described as effective immediately. The president has the authority to fire the F.B.I. director for any reason.\n\nUnder the F.B.I.’s normal rules of succession, Mr. Comey’s deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, a career F.B.I. officer, becomes acting director. The White House said the search for a new director will begin immediately.\n\nThe firing puts Democrats in a difficult position. Many had hoped that Mrs. Clinton would fire Mr. Comey soon after taking office, and blamed him as costing her the election. But under Mr. Trump, the outspoken and independent-minded Mr. Comey was seen as an important check on the new administration.\n\n“Any attempt to stop or undermine this F.B.I. investigation would raise grave constitutional issues,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. “We await clarification by the White House as soon as possible as to whether this investigation will continue and whether it will have a credible lead so that we know that it’ll have a just outcome.”\n\nSenator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, praised Mr. Comey’s service but said new leadership at the F.B.I. “will restore confidence in the organization.”\n\n“Many, including myself, have questioned his actions more than once over the last year,” Mr. Blunt, who also sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.\n\nMr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey marks the second time since taking office that the president has fired a top law enforcement official. In early February, Mr. Trump fired Sally Q. Yates, who had worked in the Obama administration but was serving as acting attorney general.\n\nComey Tried to Shield the F.B.I. From Politics. Then He Shaped an Election. As the F.B.I. investigated Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign, James B. Comey tried to keep the bureau out of politics but plunged it into the center of a bitter election.\n\nBut the president’s firing of Mr. Comey was far more consequential. Ms. Yates was a holdover, and would only have served in the Trump administration for a matter of days or weeks. By contrast, Mr. Comey was in the midst of his term as director of the bureau.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, pushed for Mr. Comey’s dismissal.\n\n“I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails,” Mr. Rosenstein wrote in another letter that was released by the White House, “and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.”\n\nA longtime prosecutor who served as the deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Comey came into office in 2013 with widespread bipartisan support. He has essentially been in a public feud with Mr. Trump since long before the presidential election.\n\nIn a Twitter message this week, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey of being “the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton,” accusing him of giving her “a free pass for many bad deeds.”\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a post on Twitter that Mr. Comey “should be immediately called to testify in an open hearing about the status of Russia/Trump investigation at the time he was fired.”\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, offered a veiled hint of the bombshell earlier in the day on Tuesday, though no reporters picked up on it.\n\nDuring his daily briefing, Mr. Spicer was asked — as he frequently is — whether Mr. Comey still has the confidence of the president. Instead of saying yes, Mr. Spicer danced around the question.\n“I have no reason to believe — I haven’t asked him,” Mr. Spicer said. “I have not asked the president since the last time we spoke about this.”\n\nA reporter noted that Mr. Spicer had previously indicated that the president did have confidence in Mr. Comey, but asked whether recent revelations about Mr. Comey’s misstatement during testimony on Capitol Hill would change that.\n\n“In light of what you’re telling me, I don’t want to start speaking on behalf of the president without speaking to him first,” Mr. Spicer said.\n\nThe president’s decision to fire Mr. Comey appeared to be the culmination of the bad will between the men that intensified in early March, when the president posted Twitter messages accusing former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his office.\n\nThe next morning, word spread quickly that Mr. Comey wanted the Justice Department to issue a statement saying that he had no evidence to support the president’s accusation. The department did not issue such a statement.\n\nFor weeks after, Mr. Trump insisted that his accusation was correct. In dramatic testimony later in March, Mr. Comey said that he had no information to back up the president’s allegations.\n\nThat set up a remarkable dynamic — an F.B.I. director directly contradicting a sitting president at the same time that the bureau was pursuing a possible criminal investigation into the president’s aides.</p>",

                  "headline": "Comey's dismissal shocks Washington",
                  "text": "<p>Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.\n\nThe bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.\n\nIn any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.\n\nWhat was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.\n\nIn recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.\n\nComey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.\n\nThe letters\n\nIn a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was \"hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,\" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is \"not able to effectively lead the bureau.\"\n\n\"It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,\" Trump told Comey in the letter. \"I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.\n\nBut multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.\n\nAt the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.\n\nJUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03\n\nRosenstein accused Comey of attempting to \"usurp the attorney general's authority\" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.\n\n\"Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,\" Rosenstein argued in his memo.\n\n\"We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),\" Rosenstein said. \"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.\"\n\nCongressional reaction\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.\n\n\"Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?\" Schumer asked\n\nAnd in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a \"loss for the bureau and the nation.\n\n\"I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,\" Burr said.\n\nAs Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.\n\n\"I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.\n\nBut Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would \"raise questions.\"\n\nSen. John McCain added: \"While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.\"\n\nThe Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.\n\n'Absurd'\n\nCNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was \"absurd.\"\n\nToobin branded the move a \"grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"This is not something that is within the American political tradition,\" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.\n\n\"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.\n\nThe White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.\n\nA senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.\n\nTeam Clinton reaction\n\nFormer Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.\n\n\"I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called \"charade\" only 24 hours ago,\" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.\n\n\"It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,\" he said.\n\nOne Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.\n\n\"I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,\" the person said.\n\nSenior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.\n\nComey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.\n\nComey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin \"forwarded hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop.\n\nThe note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \"hundreds and thousands of emails\" that Comey said were 'forwarded\" from Abedin to her husband's email \"included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.\"\n\nThe White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.\n\nComey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.\n\nIn so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.\n\nIn the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.\n\nBut Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.\n\nComey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information.\n\nThen-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the \"political\" decision.\n\nJust days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.\n\nAfter Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.\n\nLast week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\"\n\nAfter taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.\n\nHe offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.\n\n\"Oh, here's Jim,\" Trump said in January. \"He's become more famous than me.\"</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Sally Yates hearing showcased GOP loyalty to party over country. That needs to end now.\n\nBy clearing himself of colluding with the Russians in his break-up letter to James Comey, President Trump has made a pressing question even more urgent:\n\nNow that he has fired the FBI director who was overseeing the investigation into whether his campaign worked with our enemies to help get him elected, will Senate Republicans finally be forced to focus on this non-trivial matter?\n\nOr — and history will need the answer ASAP — will they respond as they did to Sally Yates and James Clapper, with less interest in how Russia vandalized our presidential election than in who leaked that news?\n\nIn sending out a spokeswoman to say it’s time to move on from all these Russia probes, Trump only underscored why Republicans can’t do that.\n\nSenators Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Richard Burr of North Carolina, who chairs the Intelligence Committee, immediately questioned the timing of the decision. Arizona’s John McCain called it disappointing. But even being among the first to state the obvious requires more courage than we’ve seen from most of their colleagues.\n\nClapper, the former national intelligence director, did everything but set himself on fire at a hearing this week to try and get Senate Republicans to look at the larger picture: “Concern about the egregious Russian interference in our election process is so critically serious as to merit focus, hopefully bipartisan focus, by the Congress and the American people.” Some spy chief, right? You didn’t need any special intel to know that wasn’t going to happen.\n\nInstead, Republicans wanted to know which Obama official to blame for “unmasking” Trump, or any of his campaign aides, in the course of their surveillance of foreign targets. Who, they wanted to know, had leaked news of Moscow’s meddling? And why again hadn’t Yates, who was acting attorney general when Trump fired her, defended his Muslim travel ban?\n\nUnfortunately for them, Yates told them, answering with a crisp, straightforward professionalism that put their own narrower concerns in an even less flattering light. The department she served for nearly three decades “will defend an action of the president...if there is a reasonable argument to be made,” Yates said of the travel ban. But only if it’s based on the truth, because “[w]e’re not just a law firm; we’re the Department of Justice.”\n\nPoor patriotic Clapper also persisted in thinking that senators needed to hear that Russia’s “activities in the run-up to the 2016 election constituted the high water mark of their long-running efforts, since the 1960s, to disrupt and influence our elections. They must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations.” And of course, planning more of the same.\n\nSo, Texan Ted Cruz asked, how about those Huma Abedin emails?\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe purity of this partisanship — straight-up party over country, without any evidence of a struggle — is why Trump’s promise to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington locked in a lot voters.\n\nNow the swamp things are trying to deflect attention from how Trump ignored Barack Obama’s direct warning that Michael Flynn, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, had lied and had been compromised by Russia. But will those voters really penalize them?\n\nNot necessarily. Up until now, anyway, rank-and-file Republicans have mirrored their leaders on the Hill. They, too, have repeated Trump’s tweeted talking points, and shown a general lack of curiosity about how Russia hacked our democracy.\n\nThat has to end now, because the moment demands it. Republicans will have to stand up to their own president instead of pretending they can’t see how serious the threat is. A threat not so much from Russia as from their own reluctance to find out why we have a president who has so far fired two people, Yates and Comey, with more allegiance to the country than to him.\n\nUntil that changes, the country will be in danger, and the status quo Trump ran against will be as safe as ever.\n\nMelinda Henneberger, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is an editorial writer and a columnist for the Kansas City Star.

He said, 'You are not under investigation.'\"\n\n\"I know I'm not under investigation,\" Trump told Holt during the 31-minute White House interview.\n\nIt would be highly unusual for someone who might be the focus of an FBI probe to ask whether he was under investigation and to be directly told by the FBI director that he was not.\n\n\nThe president also reiterated his claim that he had been planning to fire Comey even before he received Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's recommendation to do so.\n\n\"He's a showboat, he's grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil,\" Trump said of Comey in his wide-ranging interview with Holt. \"You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn't recovered from that.\"\n\nTrump said he never tried to pressure Comey into dropping the FBI probe of the Trump campaign and insisted, \"I want to find out if there was a problem in the election having to do with Russia.\"\n\nAsked by Holt if by firing Comey he was trying to send a \"lay off\" message to his successor, Trump said, \"I'm not.\"\n\n\"If Russia did anything, I want to know that,\" he said.\n\nBut Trump also insisted there was no \"collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.\"\n\n\"Also, the Russians did not affect the vote,\" he said.\n\nHolt's interview with the president came as Washington was still reeling over Trump's removal of Comey on Tuesday.\n\nTrump insisted he canned Comey because \"he was not doing a good job\" and the White House on Wednesday cited the FBI chief's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation as the reason they were firing the veteran G-man.\n\nThe Democrats, many of whom believe that Comey's intrusion into the election helped Trump win the presidency, immediately denounced the move and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor as New York Senator Charles Schumer suggested a \"cover-up\" was underway.\n\n\"The timing of Director Comey's dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling,\" Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Thursday at the opening of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.\n\n\"He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere in our election,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted Trump \"had been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected.\"\n\nAnd Trump himself tweeted later Wednesday, \"Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!\"</p>",

                  "headline": "Why Trump expected only applause when he told Comey, ‘You’re fired’",
                  "text": "<p>Donald Trump has always acted in the moment, with little regard for the past and proud contempt for the way things are usually done.\n\nFor half a century, he has believed that by refusing to be weighed down by precedent or procedure, he is liberated to come across as the brash truth-teller that the public craves. He has long said that he doesn’t care whether people believe he is dumb, ill-informed or a nasty rule-breaker; if his actions built up his bottom line, they were justified, he’d say.\n\nTrump appears to have expected that his sudden and dramatic sacking of FBI Director James B. Comey on Tuesday might be greeted the way audiences relished his ritual firings of job applicants on his hit TV show, “The Apprentice” — as a sign of power serving truth, and in this case as a politically incorrect roundhouse punch that Republicans and Democrats alike would welcome.\n\nIf the president didn’t see that his precipitous firing of the man in charge of investigating the Trump campaign’s connections with the Russian regime might instead alienate some of his allies and outrage much of the public, that’s no anomaly. Rather, it’s an illustration of several of the president’s core character traits — a belief that the past doesn’t matter, a penchant to act swiftly and unilaterally, and a conviction that even the most unpopular actions can help build his brand.\n\nNo one on either side of the aisle in Congress seemed to take seriously the administration’s argument that the president, who through much of last year led crowds in chants of “Lock her up,” was now suddenly sympathetic to the idea that Comey had inappropriately torpedoed Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\n\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nBut while TV and social media immediately hauled out not-so-old clips of Trump singing Comey’s praises for reviving the investigation into Clinton’s improper use of an email server, the president insisted Wednesday that he’d fired Comey “very simply [because] he was not doing a good job.”\n\n[Trump liked Comey. Then he didn’t. Then he did. Then he didn’t. Then he fired him.]\n\nTrump has professed the belief that the public cares only about right now, and that only news reporters and his political opponents are bothered by ping-pong statements that take him from blasting Comey for going easy on Clinton, to praising him for getting tough on her, and on to firing him for having treated her unfairly.\n\n“I think it’s startling that Democrats aren’t celebrating,” White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday. She dismissed recitations of Trump’s praise for Comey last fall as irrelevant because he said those things last fall: “The president was wearing a different hat at that time,” Sanders said. He “was a candidate, not the president.”\n\nConfronted with his past statements that stand in direct conflict with his current positions, Trump has always reacted not with remorse or embarrassment. Rather, a look of almost innocent surprise sweeps over his face and he says, as he has to reporters who remind him that he once promised to release his tax returns but then decided that he never would, “Nobody cares about this except you.”\n\n“I’m just not interested in the past,” Trump has said. “I’m interested in the present.”\n\nSo when federal judges repeatedly reject Trump’s travel ban because of his campaign statements calling for a prohibition on Muslims coming into the United States, the president sounds angry but also flummoxed, as if those past statements don’t matter because they were said in the past.\n\nView Graphic With Comey's dismissal, the Russia investigation will soon be run by Trump allies\n\n[In travel-ban case, Trump’s lawyers are pressed to explain campaign statements. ]\n\nSimilarly, Trump has a long history of viewing larger issues through the prism of how they affect him. His letter to Comey dismissing the director made only one reference to a reason for the decision, a sentence that questioned Comey’s ability to lead the bureau but noted that “I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.”\n\nTrump’s persistent focus on himself, which he has characterized as “narcissism,” a trait he believes is vital for success in the business world, was an enduring source of humor and eye-rolling through his decades as a celebrity entrepreneur. But during his campaign, Trump said that as president he would turn the focus from himself to the American people.\n\nConceding that many of his vendors, employees and bankers suffered considerable losses when his businesses went through six corporate bankruptcies, Trump said that “for myself, these were all good deals. I wasn’t representing the country. I wasn’t representing the banks. I was representing Donald Trump. So for myself, they were all good deals. . . . When I was representing myself, even deals that didn’t work out were great deals because I got tremendous tax advantages. . . . I would walk away.”\n\nAs president, Trump promised, he would flip his priorities and represent the people. How would he make that pivot? “I’ll just do it,” he said.\n\nNow, Trump faces a crisis in which Republicans and Democrats alike are questioning whether he is seeking the best possible management of the FBI or is instead trying to protect himself and his campaign staff from the prying eyes of investigators.\n\nAlmost by reflex, the language of Watergate resurged into Washington parlance after the Comey firing: Starting with comparisons to Richard M. Nixon’s “Saturday Night Massacre” — his firing of the special prosecutor who had been appointed to look into the Watergate scandal — the catchphrases of a four-decade-old scandal found new purchase: “What did the president know and when did he know it?” “The coverup is worse than the crime.”\n\n[Is the Comey firing Nixonian or uniquely Trumpian?]\n\nIn moments of crisis, presidents tend to revert to the traits that got them to the pinnacle. Nixon, stubborn and righteous, dug in as the Watergate morass deepened. “Stonewalling,” it was called, and he repeatedly refused to give up the tapes and documents that investigators and the public demanded.\n\nIn 1973, at his first news conference after the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon reflected on the media frenzy sparked by his decision. “It is true that to be under a constant barrage, 12 to 15 minutes a night on each of the three major networks for four months, tends to raise some questions in the people’s minds with regard to the president,” he said. “But now we must move on from Watergate to the business of the people.”\n\nEchoes of that strategy resounded right after the Comey firing as the president’s aides tried to brush aside concerns about the Russia investigation.\n\n“It’s time to move on,” Sanders said late Tuesday. “Frankly, it’s time to focus on the things the American people care about.”\n\nBill Clinton faced his crises by flitting from anger and denial to deeply personal confessionals — going on TV to concede “terrible moral error,” admitting to “causing pain in my marriage.”\n\nThat’s never been Trump’s style. Throughout his business career, and now in the presidency, he has proudly lived by simple mottos: Never look back. No regrets. When you’re hit, hit back 100 times harder.\n\nOften, he would try to position a defeat as a victory, or he’d argue that he lost because he wasn’t really trying to win. In the last phase of his business career, Trump rented his name to products such as steaks, bottled water and mortgages. When some of those ventures went under, Trump said he bore no responsibility for any mismanagement.\n\n“The mortgage business is not a business I particularly liked or wanted to be part of in a very big way,” he said after Trump Mortgage closed in 2007, leaving some bills unpaid.\n\nAt his darkest moments, such as when Trump faced financial ruin and a very public battle over his divorce, some business associates wondered how he managed to come to work each morning. But Trump showed no signs of distress: He “showed up every morning at 8 a.m.,” one of his top executives said, “tie tied, suit pressed, focused and moving forward.”\n\nHis family coat of arms, a regal symbol featuring a lion and a knight’s helmet, carries this Latin motto: “Numquam Concedere.”\n\n“Never Concede.”</p>",

Also there was one of the other top FBI officials interviewed only hours earlier by Sessions and Rosenstein, who are currently searching for an official \"interim\" FBI director to lead the agency until a more permanent nominee is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nMcCabe, who became deputy director of the FBI early last year, was thrust into the agency’s top position only after Sessions and Rosenstein recommended to President Donald Trump that the White House remove Comey.\n\n\"Things have been a little busy,\" McCabe said today. But, he said, McCord’s farewell was \"an event I would not have missed for the world.\"\n\nSessions made remarks, saying McCord \"represents the highest ideals that we all try to achieve every day in this work.\"\n\n\"She loves this department. She wants to do the right thing every day,\" he said, later joking that she taught him \"so many of the complexities of national security ...

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON—Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein pressed White House counsel Don McGahn to correct what he felt was an inaccurate White House depiction of the events surrounding FBI Director James Comey’s firing, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nMr. Rosenstein left the impression that he couldn’t work in an environment where facts weren’t accurately reported, the person said. The deputy attorney general objected to statements by White House aides citing Mr. Rosenstein’s critical assessment of Mr.Comey’s job performance to justify the firing.\n\nMr. Rosenstein, who had been confirmed by the Senate just two weeks earlier, met with Mr. Trump on Monday, where they discussed Mr. Comey’s job performance. At the White House’s prompting, Mr. Rosenstein Tuesday wrote a memo to the president detailing his concerns about the director’s conduct.\n\nIn that letter, Mr. Rosenstein never expressly recommended that Mr. Comey be fired.\n\nInstead, the 12-paragraph letter is deeply critical of Mr. Comey’s handling of an investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server to conduct public business. Mr. Rosenstein concluded that the FBI had lost the public’s trust and that “the director cannot be expected to implement corrective action.”\n\nThe president’s termination letter to Mr. Comey, written on the same day, began by pointing to the memos he had received from the attorney general and deputy attorney general, and offered no further explanation for his decision to fire him.\n\nMr. Rosenstein grew more distressed when, in television interviews that evening, White House advisers reiterated that the decision was made in response to the Justice Department’s recommendation.\n\nAsked Tuesday why Mr. Trump was firing Mr. Comey four months into his term, senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said: “Well, I would point them to the three letters that were received today.”\n\nSarah Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, told Fox News on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had reacted after receiving a “clear and direct and very strong recommendation from the deputy attorney general.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent Washington into a frenzy on Tuesday evening when he fired FBI Director James Comey, citing criticism of his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib looks at the timing of Mr. Trump's decision. Photo: Getty\n\nMs. Sanders, on MSNBC the following morning, said the reason for the dismissal was “real simple ... The deputy attorney general made a very strong recommendation.”\n\nWednesday morning, Vice President Mike Pence, speaking to reporters at the Capitol, repeatedly pointed to Mr. Rosenstein’s letter while describing the president’s decision.\n\nMr. Rosenstein called Mr. McGahn and urged them to correct the record.\n\nIn a Wednesday afternoon news briefing, Ms. Sanders started to shift the White House narrative.\n\nAsked about the tipping point in Mr. Trump’s decision to dismiss Mr. Comey, she responded: “He’d lost confidence in Director Comey, and, frankly, he’d been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected.”\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAsked if Mr. Trump had directed Mr. Rosenstein to write a recommendation that Mr. Comey be fired, she said, “No.”\n\nLater that evening, the White House circulated a timeline of events leading up to Mr. Comey’s dismissal that had been authored by the Justice Department.\n\nThe timeline didn’t mention Mr. Rosenstein’s letter until the fourth bullet point, and said Mr. Trump had been “strongly inclined” to remove Mr. Comey after watching his testimony in front of a Senate panel last week.\n\nSubsequently, administration officials said Mr. Trump had been growing increasingly frustrated by the former director’s demonstrative performances in a series of congressional hearings, combined with his refusal to clear Mr. Trump’s campaign of any wrongdoing, put the president over the edge.\n\nBy the time Mr. Comey testified last week before a Senate panel about his handling of the Clinton email probe, saying he would make the same choices again even though it made him “mildly nauseous” to think he might have affected the election result, Mr. Trump was “strongly inclined to remove him,” a White House official said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) Thursday demanded further explanation for the firing of Mr. Comey. He said on the Senate floor that he would soon be sending Mr. Rosenstein a letter with a list of questions the lawmaker said he wanted to be answered publicly.\n\nMr. Rosenstein won the backing of most Senate Democrats when he was confirmed to his position late last month in an overwhelming 94-6 vote.\n\nMr. Schumer said Thursday that Democrats voted for Mr. Rosenstein “because he had a reputation for integrity” and assured them that he would act independently at the Justice Department.\n\n“The events of the last week have made many of us question that belief,” Mr. Schumer said.\n\nActing FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who succeeded Mr. Comey, also contradicted a White House assertion that the bureau had lost confidence in James Comey’s leadership. “The vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey,” Mr. McCabe said.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Ian Prior Thursday denied reports that Mr. Rosenstein had threatened to quit over the White House depiction of the events leading up to Mr. Comey’s dismissal. He declined to comment further.\n\nA White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) offered a withering assessment of the Rosenstein memo and urged that he recuse himself from the FBI’s probe into whether there were ties between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling in last year’s presidential race.\n\n“I’ve now read Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s memo three times. With each read I’ve become more troubled by the contents of this unusual document,” she said.\n\nRather than a dispassionate analysis, she said, the “memo reads like political document. It includes quotes from op-eds and television appearances that are as old as six months. It doesn’t include any contemporary insights from inside the FBI. The memo appears to have been hastily assembled to justify a preordained outcome.”\n\nRepublicans focused on a different angle Thursday as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged the FBI to say publicly whether it was investigating Mr. Trump. That question has resurfaced because in his brief letter firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said that “I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.”\n\nThose close to Mr. Comey disputed that the director had provided such assurances. Mr. McCabe, the acting FBI director, promised a Senate Committee Thursday that he wouldn’t provide status updates to the White House on the Russia probe.\n\nBut Mr. Grassley said the FBI should clarify the matter. “It should confirm to the public whether it is or is not investigating the president,” he said. “Because it has failed to make this clear, speculation has run rampant.”\n\nOne of Russia’s goals, Mr. Grassley said, is to undermine Americans’ faith in U.S. institutions, and the FBI’s silence plays into that objective.\n\nThe FBI has given no indication it would be willing to make such a statement.\n\n—Michael C.

Comey didn't want to do it. He didn't even want the rank and file at the FBI to know about it.\"\n\nBut in the end, \"He's still the commander in chief. He's your boss. How do you say no?\"\n\nThe New York Times first reported Thursday night that Trump demanded during the dinner that Comey declare his loyalty to the president, and that Comey declined. Comey told Trump he would offer \"honesty,\" The Times reported.\n\nThe current and former official could not confirm that account. But the former official said, \"That is exactly how I would expect the director to answer.\"\n\nThe former official, like many current and former FBI officials interviewed by NBC News, said the bureau was reeling from the Comey firing. Not everyone agreed with each Comey decisions, but he was a popular and well-regarded director, they said.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed Thursday that she had heard from \"countless members of the FBI who are grateful for the president's decision.\"\n\nCurrent and former FBI agents scoffed at what they termed a ridiculous assertion.\n\n\"I doubt five people at the FBI even have the [phone] number of the deputy White House press secretary,\" the former senior official said.\n\nNBC News reported Thursday that the White House abandoned an initial idea for Trump to visit FBI headquarters, after learning he would not be greeted warmly there.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — In an ominous warning, President Donald Trump declared Friday that fired FBI Director James Comey had better hope there are no \"tapes\" of their private conversations. Trump's tweet came the morning after he asserted Comey had told him three times he wasn't under FBI investigation.\n\nComey has not confirmed Trump's account, which concerns the FBI's probe of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and allegations of Trump campaign collaboration with the Russians.\n\nAnd on Friday, a person close to the former director recounted a Comey-Trump dinner in January in which Trump asked for a pledge of loyalty. Comey declined, instead offering \"honest.\" When Trump then pressed for \"honest loyalty,\" Comey told him, \"You will have that,\" recounted the Comey associate.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders disputed that report and said the president would \"never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty.\" Officials did not immediately respond to questions about whether Trump recorded his discussions with the FBI director.\n\nDetails of the dinner were first reported by The New York Times\n\nTrump, in an interview Thursday with NBC News, had this version: \"I said, 'If it's possible, would you let me know, am I under investigation?' He said you are not under investigation.\" Trump said the discussions happened in two phone calls and at a dinner in which Comey was asking to keep his job.\n\nThe president's Twitter comments on Friday again raised the specter of Richard Nixon, whose secretly taped conversations and telephone calls in the White House ultimately led to his downfall in the Watergate scandal. Trump's firing of Comey already has left him with the dubious distinction of being the first president since Nixon to fire a law enforcement official overseeing an investigation tied to the White House.\n\nTrump was widely known to record some phone conversations at his office in Trump Tower during his business career, sometimes remarking to aides after a call as to whether or not he had taped that one.\n\n\"I would note that New York is a one-party consent state, and President Trump has always abided by the law,\" said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide, noting that it is not required in New York for both parties on a call to be aware that it was being recorded.\n\nAssociates of the former FBI director, who remained out of sign Friday at his suburban Virginia home, said they believed any recording would validate Comey's side of the story.\n\n\"It would be great were they recorded,\" said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said Friday that Trump was \"dangerous\" and that \"his credibility has been destroyed.\"\n\nDurbin, on \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC, suggested that the president's move to fire Comey amid its Trump-Russia investigation was \"dangerous because he may be obstructing justice.\" And he said he feared the world would no longer take Trump at his word.\n\nTrump, in his NBC interview, said he had been intending to fire Comey for months and that it had nothing to do with the Russia investigation.\n\nBut he also said, \"In fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\"\n\nEven before Trump's provocative tweets, the White House was scrambling to clarify why Comey was fired.\n\nThe White House initially cited a Justice Department memo criticizing Comey's handling of last year's investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails as the impetus.\n\nThe shifting accounts of the decision to fire Comey, whom Trump derided as a \"showboat\" and \"grandstander,\" added to a mounting sense of uncertainty and chaos in the West Wing, as aides scrambled to get their stories straight and appease an angry president.\n\nEarlier Thursday, on Capitol Hill, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe strongly disputed the White House's assertion that Comey had been fired in part because he had lost the confidence of the FBI's own rank-and-file.\n\nMcCabe also pointed out the remarkable nature of Trump's version of his conversations with Comey. McCabe told a Senate panel it was not \"standard practice\" to tell an individual whether they are or are not under investigation.\n\nPrevious presidents have made a public show of staying out of legal matters, so as not to appear to be injecting politics.\n\nThe ousted director himself is said to be confident that his own version of events will come out, possibly in an appearance before Congress, according to an associate who has been in touch with him since his firing Tuesday.\n\nTrump and Comey's relationship was strained early on, in part because of the president's explosive and unsubstantiated claims that Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Comey found the allegations confounding, according to his associate, and wondered what to make of what he described as strange thoughts coming from his new boss.\n\nThe president was no kinder to Comey on Thursday, calling him names and saying he'd left the FBI in \"virtual turmoil.\" He said that while he received a scathing assessment of Comey's performance from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Monday, that memo was not a catalyst for his dramatic decision as the White House had said earlier.\n\n\"I was going to fire Comey,\" Trump said. \"Regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey.\"\n\nThat's far different from the White House's initial account in the hours after Comey's firing. Multiple officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, said the president was acting at the behest of Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe White House said Trump is weighing options for replacing Comey, a decision that could have broad implications for the future of the Russia investigation. Some senior officials have discussed nominating Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who ran the House committee that investigated Secretary of State Clinton's actions in connection with the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nMcCabe characterized the investigation as \"highly significant\" and assured senators that Comey's firing would not hinder it. He promised he would tolerate no interference from the White House and would not provide the administration with updates on its progress.\n\n\"You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,\" he declared. He said there has been no interference so far.\n\n___\n\nPearson and Lemire reported from New York.

                  "text": "<p>“That I can’t talk about. I won’t talk about it,” the president told Fox News. “All I want is for Comey to be honest.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo president in the past 40 years has been known to regularly tape his phone calls or meetings because, among other reasons, they could be subpoenaed by investigators as they were during the Watergate investigation that ultimately forced President Richard M. Nixon to resign. Phone calls with foreign leaders, though, are typically transcribed with the knowledge of other participants.\n\nDemocrats expressed shock. “For a president who baselessly accused his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him, that Mr. Trump would suggest that he, himself, may have engaged in such conduct is staggering,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “The president should immediately provide any such recordings to Congress or admit, once again, to have made a deliberately misleading — and in this case threatening — statement.”\n\nRepresentatives John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrats on the judiciary and oversight committees, sent a letter to the White House on Friday demanding copies of any recordings if they exist. The letter noted that “it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked if the president records his conversations, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, would not say. “The president has nothing further to add on that,” Mr. Spicer said, repeating the answer or some variation of it several more times as reporters pressed.\n\nHe denied that the president was threatening the former F.B.I. director. “That’s not a threat,” Mr. Spicer said. “He simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself. I’m moving on.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe matter arose in a series of early-morning Twitter messages in which Mr. Trump appeared agitated over news reports on Friday that focused on contradictory accounts of his decision to fire Mr. Comey at the same time the F.B.I. is investigating ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. Among other things, he threatened to cancel future White House briefings.\n\nThe president expressed pique at attention on the shifting versions of how he came to decide to fire Mr. Comey. In his first extended comments on the firing on Thursday, Mr. Trump contradicted statements made by his White House spokeswoman as well as comments made to reporters by Vice President Mike Pence and even the letter the president himself signed and sent to Mr. Comey informing him of his dismissal.\n\nThe original White House version of the firing was that the president acted on the recommendation of the attorney general and deputy attorney general because of Mr. Comey’s handling of last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email. But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had already decided to fire Mr. Comey and would have done so regardless of any recommendation. And he indicated that he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he made the decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nImplicitly acknowledging that misinformation had been given out, Mr. Trump said on Friday morning that no one should expect his White House to give completely accurate information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!” he wrote on Twitter.\n\n“Maybe,” he added a few moments later, “the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ‘press briefings’ and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???”\n\nThe threat may have been just a rhetorical point, and the daily briefing already scheduled for later in the day went forward with Mr. Spicer, despite the Twitter post. Mr. Spicer declined to say whether the president had decided to stop holding daily news briefings, saying that Mr. Trump is “a little dismayed” about the unwillingness of reporters to focus on the policy actions of his administration.\n\n“We see time and time again an attempt to parse every little word and make it a game of gotcha,” Mr. Spicer said.\n\nIn a later interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump suggested he was seriously thinking about canceling the briefings. “Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don’t have them,” he said. “I think it’s a good idea.”\n\nJeff Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters and the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said the group would object to canceling briefings. “Doing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned,” he said.\n\nEvery president in modern times has been frustrated with the news media at points, but they all preserved the tradition of the daily briefing, if for no other reason than to get their message out. Mr. Trump, with Twitter as his own trumpet, may feel less need for that. By his own description, Mr. Trump likes to be unpredictable and does not feel obligated to follow longstanding White House conventions simply because that is the way things have been done for years.\n\nThere is already precedent for shutting down news briefings during Mr. Trump’s presidency. The State Department for decades held daily briefings with only rare and brief interruptions in a process that was important not only to inform reporters of administration policy, but foreign governments and even the department’s own far-flung diplomats. But such briefings have largely ended during the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Trump has long been said by allies and former employees to have taped some of his own phone calls, as well as meetings in his Trump Tower offices. During the campaign, Mr. Trump’s aides working on the fifth floor of Trump Tower told reporters they feared their offices were bugged by the candidate’s security team, and they were careful about what they said.\n\nBut the implicit threat to Mr. Comey was ripped from a familiar playbook that Mr. Trump relied on during the campaign to silence critics or dissent. During the Republican primaries, he read aloud the mobile telephone number of one rival, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, from the stage at a rally and encouraged people to flood his phone with calls.\n\nAt another point, he threatened on Twitter to tell stories about Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the co-hosts of the MSNBC show “Morning Joe,” after they criticized him. He also railed against the wealthy Ricketts family as it was funding anti-Trump efforts, threatening to air some unspecified dirty laundry. And while competing with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the Republican presidential nomination, he threatened to expose something unflattering about his opponent’s wife. “Be careful, Lyin’ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!” he said.\n\nIn this case, however, the Twitter comment comes in the context of an F.B.I. investigation, and some experts said the president was skirting a legal line. Samuel W. Buell, a Duke University law professor and former federal prosecutor who led the Enron task force, said that Mr. Trump’s warning on Twitter to quiet Mr. Comey could be viewed as an effort to intimidate a witness for any current or future investigation into whether the firing of the F.B.I. director amounted to obstruction of justice.\n\n“If this were an actual criminal investigation — in other words, if there were a prosecutor and a defense lawyer in the picture — this would draw a severe phone call to counsel warning that the defendant is at serious risk of indictment if he continues to speak to witnesses,” Mr. Buell said. “Thus, this is also definitive evidence that Trump is not listening to counsel and perhaps not even talking to counsel. Unprecedented in the modern presidency.”\n\nThis is not the first time an administration has challenged Mr. Comey’s version of a prominent conversation. During President George W. Bush’s administration, White House officials disputed Mr. Comey’s account of a hospital room standoff in which Mr. Bush’s top aides tried to pressure John D. Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general, to reauthorize a controversial surveillance program.\n\nMr. Comey, then the deputy attorney general, was eventually vindicated because the F.B.I. director at the time, Robert S. Mueller III, kept his notes from the encounter — a reminder that note-taking is steeped in the F.B.I. culture.\n\nMr. Trump’s mention of tapes did nothing to dispel the echoes of Watergate heard in Washington this week. His dismissal of Mr. Comey in the midst of an investigation into Mr. Trump’s associates struck many as similar to Nixon’s decision in October 1973 to fire Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, in an episode that came to be known as the Saturday Night Massacre.\n\nIn that case, Nixon was mad at Mr. Cox for seeking access to secret White House tapes of the president’s conversations. The Supreme Court eventually forced Nixon to turn over the tapes, which contained evidence pointing to his involvement in the cover-up of the Watergate burglary and led to his resignation in August 1974.\n\nThe difference, according to Luke A. Nichter, a historian at Texas A&M University who has specialized in the Nixon tapes, is that “Nixon’s rantings were done in private, on his tapes,” and he did not cancel press briefings.\n\n“The reason I have a hard time with the label Nixonian is that we’ve surpassed it,” Mr. Nichter said. “To be Trumpian is something of a greater magnitude than simply being Nixonian.”\n\nMr. Trump’s defenders have said that Watergate comparisons are overwrought and that there is no evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia during last year’s election. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia tried to meddle in the campaign with the aim of tilting the election to Mr. Trump.\n\nThe president has said that any suspicions of collusion are “fake news” and that the Russia investigation is the product of Democrats who are sore losers looking to explain away an election defeat and undermine his legitimacy.\n\n“Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election,” he wrote on Twitter on Friday morning.\n\nHe added later that James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, has testified that he knew of no collusion. Mr. Clapper left office on Jan. 20 with the end of President Barack Obama’s administration and has not been involved in any investigation since then.\n\n“When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?” Mr. Trump asked.\n\nLawmakers have given conflicting and vague assessments of the evidence so far. A couple of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Schiff and Representative Eric Swalwell of California, have said there is at least some evidence of collusion, but when Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was asked last week if there was, she said, “Not at this time.”</p>",

Trump told NBC he thought Comey asked for the dinner, but the source denied the President's account, saying that if Comey had wanted to dine with Trump, he would have had to put the request in through the deputy attorney general.\n\n\"It doesn't work that way. It's ludicrous,\" the source said.\n\nA few days before the dinner, Comey had already been told by the President that he would stay on the job, the source said.\n\n\"It is absolutely untrue that Jim asked to have dinner or that he asked to have his job,\" the source said. \"That is a complete fabrication.\"\n\nAs CNN has previously reported, Comey's refusal to pledge loyalty is one of the reasons the President fired him, the other being the acceleration of the probe into alleged collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, another source close to Comey has said.\n\nThe source said Comey knew it was possible he would lose his job, especially when he did not agree to pledge loyalty and later with the fallout over refuting the President's claims that President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower, but he didn't expect it when he was fired.\n\nThe source said Comey is likely not going to testify next week to Senate intelligence. As of Friday morning, Comey had not responded to the request.\n\n\"He loved his job and the mission,\" said the source, who added, \"he'll be fine.\"\n\nThe source also confirmed previously reported accounts that Comey learned of his firing by catching it on TV -- initially, Comey thought it was a joke, and teased agents around him for teasing him. Then someone pull him aside and told him it was true, the source said.\n\nThe source said Comey thought at least he would get a phone call, adding, \"the way (Trump) did it was remarkable.\"\n\nShifting accounts of firing\n\nThe initial, official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\n\nBut mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.\n\nSources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was \"mildly nauseous\" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was \"not possible\" for his team to recount details and talking points with \"perfect accuracy.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.\n\nTrump told NBC's Lester Holt: \"And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'\"\n\nTrump also reiterated in the interview Thursday that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation for his campaign's alleged ties to Russian intelligence officials.\n\n\"He told me that ... and I've heard that from others,\" Trump told Holt.\n\nThe President said Comey told him he was not under investigation once during a \"very nice dinner\" and two other times over the phone -- comments consistent with the letter Trump sent Comey informing him that he had been fired: \"While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThere are still questions, however, as to whether Comey actually did tell Trump he was not under investigation at the dinner on January 27 and two more times by phone. Those close to Comey tell CNN they find it hard to believe he would speak about an ongoing investigation. Still, the conversations were one-on-one, making it impossible for the sources to know for sure.\n\nOne source was unwilling to tell CNN what was said about the investigation except that what was discussed was more nuanced than the way the President described it.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said as well in remarks at a committee markup Thursday that he and ranking member Dianne Feinstein \"heard nothing that contradicted the President's statement\" when Comey briefed them about the targets of the various investigations. Grassley added: \"It would not be appropriate for me to reveal those details before the professionals conducting the investigations are ready.\"</p>",

Comey consumed Capitol Hill’s attention. Democrats slowed committee business in the Senate to protest the lack of an independent investigation into Russia’s election meddling, and Republicans saw rifts emerge as more questioned the president’s decision.\n\nIn deciding to abruptly fire FBI Director James B. Comey, President Trump characteristically let himself be guided by his own instincts — fueled by his creeping anger and sense of victimhood about a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election that he considers a “witch hunt.”\n\nThe aftermath is a presidency rocked by its most serious self-inflicted crisis yet, exposing dysfunction and distrust within his West Wing and imperiling his agenda. The momentum for the health-care bill that passed the House is gone, and a week scheduled to be devoted to Trump’s preparations for a high-stakes foreign trip was overtaken by distractions and fury.\n\nAcross Washington, Trump’s allies have been buzzing about the staff’s competence as well as the president’s state of mind. One GOP figure close to the White House mused privately about whether Trump was “in the grip of some kind of paranoid delusion.”\n\nTrump has been stewing all week, aggrieved by sharp media scrutiny of his decision to fire Comey and of his and his aides’ ever-shifting explanations, and has been quick to blame his staff, according to several people who have spoken with him.\n\nPrivately, Trump has lashed out at the communications office — led by press secretary Sean Spicer and communications director Michael Dubke — and has spoken candidly with advisers about a broad shake-up that could include demotions or dismissals. The president personally has conducted postmortem interviews with aides about the Comey saga, investigating the unending stream of headlines he considers unfairly negative, according to several White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Trump is cracking down on unauthorized leaks.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\n“This was the first major crisis or test they’ve had, and it looks like a lot of systems failed,” said Chris Ruddy, a Trump confidant and chief executive of Newsmax. “My experience with the president is when he sees failure, he quickly adapts and tries new things. He’s not a guy that keeps the same ol’.”\n\nThe system may be failing, but it is Trump picking which buttons to press. The president takes pride in being the ultimate decision-maker, for matters large and small. And chaos has been a hallmark of Trump’s enterprises, from his family real estate empire to his presidential campaign, a 16-month venture during which he cycled through three leadership teams.\n\n[Inside Trump’s anger and impatience — and his sudden decision to fire Comey]\n\nInside the White House, there was widespread agreement that Comey had to go. But how and when Trump would fire him — and how it would be rationalized to the public — was the subject of considerable debate.\n\nVice President Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, senior adviser Jared Kushner, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Counsel Donald McGahn were the closest to the president as he weighed his options, according to White House officials.\n\nWould Trump first visit with Comey in person and ask for his resignation or fire him abruptly?\n\nThe president decided the latter.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nWould Trump slow down the process so that a communications strategy could be crafted, with credible surrogates lined up to defend his decision, or terminate Comey about 24 hours after first telling top aides he wanted it done?\n\nHe chose the latter.\n\nWould Trump stick to the agreed-upon explanation for Comey’s ouster or invoke the Russia investigation, both in his Tuesday termination letter to Comey and two days later in a television interview? And would he be restrained on Twitter, as his advisers have urged, or peck out a provocative salvo at Comey warning of possible “tapes” of their private conversations?\n\nIn both cases, Trump again chose the less prudent path.\n\nWhite House aides have felt bewildered and alarmed by how Trump arrives at his decisions — often on impulse and emotion and sometimes by rejecting the counsel of those around him — and how he then communicates those decisions to his personnel and the public. Trump is in some ways like a pilot opting to fly a plane through heavy turbulence then blaming the flight attendants when the passengers get jittery.\n\nThe result is a hardening portrait of sheer disarray.\n\n“The Comey firing is just the most dramatic example of a White House that is completely dysfunctional, the most chaotic in modern history,” said Chris Whipple, author “The Gatekeepers,” a newly published history of White House chiefs of staff.\n\n“Reince Priebus has made rookie mistake after rookie mistake,” Whipple said. “But ultimately, it’s fundamentally on Donald Trump. A chief of staff can do very little to make the White House function if he’s not empowered by his president. That simply has not happened.”\n\nRobert M. Gates, a former defense secretary who informally advised Trump during the transition, criticized his handling of Comey’s ouster.\n\n“Not terribly well done,” Gates told John Dickerson in a CBS News interview scheduled to air Sunday on “Face the Nation.”\n\n“I fired a lot of senior people myself, and I think the key, when you feel compelled to remove a senior official, is essentially to have all your ducks in a row at the beginning,” he continued. “To have the rationale, have everybody understand what the rationale was. If possible, to be in a position to announce who is going to step in as the interim immediately. And, if possible, to announce who you’re going to nominate to replace that person.”\n\nAs Trump’s anger with the Comey fallout boiled over, his aides have been pointing fingers at one other.\n\nMuch of the internal blame has fallen to the communications operation, with Kushner and other top officials questioning why the small army of press staffers led by Spicer and Dubke took so long to forcefully defend the president’s decision and agree to a set of talking points that could withstand scrutiny, according to several White House officials.\n\nInside the West Wing, it became a running joke among some staffers that the answer to every question would be “Rosenstein,” referring to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who wrote a memo outlining a case for Comey’s ouster.\n\nTrump loyalists were particularly upset that Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) organized a news conference Tuesday night and got other Democrats to parrot the same message before a full explanation came out of the White House — despite the fact that the White House controlled every variable of the story.\n\n“They were running around like chickens with their heads cut off,” said one White House official. “There was no leadership, no ‘get your troops in a room and issue orders and execute.’ ”\n\nYet Trump did not inform Spicer and Dubke of his decision until about an hour before it was announced, keeping them and other senior aides out of the loop because he feared the news might leak prematurely, officials said.\n\nThere is confusion about whether Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist who had been somewhat marginalized after feuding last month with Kushner, was among those the president consulted about his decision. Two people familiar with the matter said Bannon intentionally was kept out of the process. But a third person denied that Bannon first learned Comey had been fired from television news reports and said that he had actually counseled Trump to delay his decision to lessen the political backlash.\n\nSpicer and Dubke did not respond to a request for an interview. Their defenders said they were assigned an impossible task of orchestrating on short notice a complete roll-out plan — from crafting and distributing talking points to lining up lawmakers, legal experts and other Trump supporters to give interviews.\n\nThe explanation delivered Tuesday night by Spicer, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway and deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders — that Trump acted decisively at the recommendation of Rosenstein and Sessions — was discussed with and agreed to by the president himself, officials said.\n\nTrump then changed his story, telling NBC News on Thursday that he made the decision to fire Comey on his own and would have done so “regardless” of Rosenstein’s recommendation.\n\n“We were absolutely given the information that we could have at that time,” Sanders told reporters Thursday. “It was a quick-moving process. We took the information we had, as best we had it, and got it out to the American people as quickly as we could.”\n\nTrump defended his spokesmen, tweeting Friday that they should not be expected to speak with “perfect accuracy” and later complaining to Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro about the “level of hostility” against them. But Trump went on to tell Pirro that he was considering canceling regular press briefings — except for when he does them himself.\n\nSome of Trump’s allies said they are worried that the president views the Comey episode entirely as a public-affairs crisis — a branding problem — and has not been judicious about protecting himself from legal exposure as the FBI continues to investigate possible links between his campaign and Russia.\n\nWhen Trump sat down for the interview with NBC anchor Lester Holt, his aides were not certain what he might say. The president improvised, essentially — and, in one stream-of-consciousness answer, invited potential legal peril by connecting his firing of Comey to the Russia matter.\n\n“In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,’ ” Trump told Holt.\n\nTrump also revealed that he had asked Comey on three separate occasions — once over dinner and twice in phone calls — whether he was under investigation by the FBI and said that Comey had told him he was not.\n\nIt is Justice Department policy that ongoing investigations generally are not to be discussed with White House officials.\n\n“Trump is so unsophisticated about government, and he lacks even basic knowledge about how the government functions, of what the unwritten but very important rules and traditions are. His attitude toward all those things is they don’t matter: ‘I’m going to drain the swamp!’ ” said a veteran of past Republican administrations who is close to the Trump White House and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly critique the president.\n\nPollster Patrick H. Caddell, a longtime confidant of Bannon who served in Jimmy Carter’s White House, said he was pained to watch the Trump White House struggle.\n\n“It’s like reliving the Carter administration on steroids,” Caddell said. “This is an outsider administration being surrounded by Apache knives. Every inch of the political class and both parties are going after him. The president can’t afford in this type of environment to not execute these kinds of announcements better.”\n\nDamian Paletta and Robert Costa contributed to this report.</p>",

Trump said he had been thinking about dismissing Comey ever since he took office, but there was never going to be an appropriate time to do it.\n\n\"Let's say I did it on January 20, the opening, right, and that would have been the big story as opposed to the inauguration,\" Trump said. \"I was thinking about it then. I was thinking about it during this period of time. There's really no right time to do it.\"\n\nTrump added, \"But I mean, I'm OK with it.\"\n\nIn the initial moments after Comey’s firing, Trump's press secretary, deputy press secretary and Vice President Mike Pence all said Trump's decision was based on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But on Friday, Trump contradicted his press office and Pence, telling NBC that he was going to fire Comey \"regardless\" of Rosenstein's recommendation.\n\nAsked about the differing statements he and his White House offered, Trump said, \"Well, that's an interesting situation,\" and admitted he toyed with the idea to stop White House press briefings.\n\n\"I actually said today, let's not ever do any more press briefings,\" Trump told Fox News.\n\nBut then Trump went on to argue that his administration's press briefings get high ratings and that networks would \"start to cry\" if he canceled them.\n\n\"These press conferences are like the biggest thing on daytime television,\" Trump said.\n\nPressed by Pirro on whether he was seriously considering doing away with the press briefings, Trump suggested he would conduct them in a \"different way\" -- either giving the press \"a piece of paper with a perfectly accurate, beautiful answer,\" or holding them himself.\n\n\"We just don't have them, unless I have them every two weeks and I do myself. We don't have them. I think it's a good idea,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump argued the hostility he feels from the press and because he’s such an active president that his spokespeople cannot keep up with him are reasons to consider getting rid of press briefings.\n\nIn the wake of recent reports that Trump is considering replacing his press secretary Sean Spicer, Trump defended Spicer as a “wonderful human\" and a \"nice man.\"</p>",

Comey prepared extensively for his discussions with President Trump, out of concern that the president was unlikely to respect the legal and ethical boundaries governing their respective roles, according to associates of the now-fired FBI chief.\n\nThe associates recounted how worried Comey was about meeting with Trump and recalled conversations in which they brainstormed how to handle moments in which the president asked for details of an investigation.\n\nOne associate referred to Comey’s preparation as a kind of “murder board” — a phrase used to describe a committee of questioners that hurls tough questions at someone as practice for a difficult oral examination.\n\n“He was pretty insistent that he would have to find a way to politically not answer it,” one associate recalled. “He was confident that he was not going to sacrifice the independence of the investigation, or his own moral compass, but at the same time, he would not try to purposely inflame his commander in chief.”\n\nThe president abruptly fired Comey on May 9, raising questions about whether he was attempting to interfere in the ongoing FBI probe into possible coordination between Trump associates and Russian operatives seeking to meddle in last year’s presidential election.\n\nComey was very apprehensive heading into a dinner with the president in late January, because of his previous encounters with Trump during the transition and immediately after the inauguration, according to one associate. Comey felt as if Trump did not understand or did not like the FBI director’s independence and was trying to get Comey to bend the rules for him, the associate said.\n\nWhite House officials have disputed the accuracy of a memo Comey wrote describing what was said at the January dinner. In it, associates said, Comey described an effort by the president to get him to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn his preparation for meeting Trump, Comey made clear to associates that he wanted to be responsive to the president’s questions while declining to discuss sensitive subjects “in a manner that did not come across as a slap in the face,’’ said the associate, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBefore going to the dinner, Comey practiced Trump’s likely questions and his answers with a small group of his most trusted confidants, the associates said, in part to ensure he did not give Trump any ammunition to use against him later.\n\nThe director did not take notes during the dinner with the president, but there were times, one associate recalled, when after meeting with Trump, Comey started writing notes as soon as he got into a car, “to make sure he could accurately record what was said.’’\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAnother associate said the notes of the January dinner conversation contained very nuanced quotes from the president and a high level of detail.\n",

In that case, Comey would be a witness and Mueller will likely interview him as part of the probe.\n\nPotentially complicating that effort is Comey's acceptance to testify on Capitol Hill after Memorial Day.

Wittes says Comey was reluctant to attend and tried his best to not have any personal conversation with Trump. At one point, Wittes recalls, Comey stood in a position so that his blue blazer would blend in with the room's blue drapes in an effort for Trump to not notice him.\n\nThat tactic was unsuccessful; Trump later called him out by name, leading to a greeting captured on camera.\n\n\"He did not regard the people in the Trump White House as honorable?

His press conference caused a firestorm of controversy and drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nComey's actions based on what he knew was Russian disinformation offer a stark example of the way Russian interference impacted the decisions of the highest-level US officials during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Wednesday that this Russian intelligence was unreliable. US officials now tell CNN that Comey and FBI officials actually knew early on that this intelligence was indeed false.\n\nIn fact, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe went to Capitol Hill Thursday to push back on the notion that the FBI was duped, according to a source familiar with a meeting McCabe had with members of the Senate intelligence committee.\n\nThe Russian intelligence at issue purported to show that then-Attorney General Lynch had been compromised in the Clinton investigation. The intelligence described emails between then-Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and a political operative suggesting that Lynch would make the FBI investigation of Clinton go away.\n\nIn classified sessions with members of Congress several months ago, Comey described those emails in the Russian claim and expressed his concern that this Russian information could \"drop\" and that would undermine the Clinton investigation and the Justice Department in general, according to one government official.\n\nStill, Comey did not let on to lawmakers that there were doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to sources familiar with the briefings. It is unclear why Comey was not more forthcoming in a classified setting.\n\nSources close to Comey tell CNN he felt that it didn't matter if the information was accurate, because his big fear was that if the Russians released the information publicly, there would be no way for law enforcement and intelligence officials to discredit it without burning intelligence sources and methods. There were other factors behind Comey's decision, sources say.\n\nIn at least one classified session, Comey cited that intelligence as the primary reason he took the unusual step of publicly announcing the end of the Clinton email probe.\n\nIn that briefing, Comey did not even mention the other reason he gave in public testimony for acting independently of the Justice Department -- that Lynch was compromised because Bill Clinton boarded her plane and spoke to her during the investigation, these sources told CNN.\n\nMultiple US officials tell CNN that to this day Russia is trying to spread false information in the US -- through elected officials and American intelligence and law enforcement operatives -- in order to cloud and confuse ongoing investigations.</p>",

Patrick Leahy and Al Franken -- Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- sent the requests to Comey and, later, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe in three letters dated March 20, April 28 and May 12.\n\n\"We are concerned about Attorney General Sessions' lack of candor to the committee and his failure thus far to accept responsibility for testimony that could be construed as perjury,\" Franken and Leahy wrote to Comey in their first request.\n\nThe Democrats have not received a response from the FBI to their three letters, a Senate source said.\n\nLeahy and Franken both grilled Sessions during his nomination hearing about any contacts he had with Russian officials about the 2016 campaign. At the time, Sessions said he had none. But following a Washington Post report that showed Sessions had met twice with Kislyak, Sessions acknowledged the meetings and recused himself from oversight of the Russia probe.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that congressional investigators were now examining whether Sessions and Kislyak met a third time.\n\n\"Earlier this year, Attorney General Sessions provided false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to our questions regarding his contacts with Russian officials,\" Franken and Leahy said in a joint statement Thursday. \"The attorney general never fully explained or even acknowledged the misrepresentations in his testimony, and we remained concerned that he had still not been forthcoming about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials.\"\n\nLeahy and Franken said that, if Sessions did perjure himself, he should resign.\n\n\"We served with the attorney general in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee for many years,\" they wrote. \"We know he would not tolerate dishonesty if he were in our shoes. If it is determined that the attorney general still has not been truthful with Congress and the American people about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign, he needs to resign.\"\n\nIn regard to CNN's report about congressional investigators' examination of another possible meeting between Sessions and Kislyak, a spokeswoman for Sessions deferred questions to the special counsel in the Russia probe, Robert Mueller.\n\n\"The Department of Justice appointed special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter. We will allow him to do his job,\" said DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores.\n\nFlores also criticized anonymous sources cited by CNN and said that Sessions never had a third meeting with Kislyak.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that anonymous sources whose credibility will never face public scrutiny are continuously trying to hinder that process by peddling false stories to the mainstream media. The facts haven't changed; the then-Senator did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.\"</p>",

In the memo, according to sources close to Comey who reviewed it, Trump said: \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\" during a February meeting.\n\nThe request made Comey uncomfortable, but the source tells ABC News that Comey has told associates he will not accuse the President of obstructing justice.\n\n“He is not going to Congress to make accusations about the President’s intent, instead he’s there to share his concerns,” the source said, and tell the committee “what made him uneasy” and why he felt a need to write the memo documenting the conversation.\n\nSome legal experts told ABC News that Trump's requests as detailed in the memo, which ABC News has not seen, could meet the legal definition of obstruction.\n\nComey told associates he plans to testify that despite the unusual request from the president he believed strongly that if he did his job properly he could conduct the investigation in an honest way.\n\nHowever, Comey has told associates he will not corroborate Trump's claim that on three separate occasions Comey told the president he was not under investigation as part of the probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. election, a source familiar the former director’s thinking told ABC News.\n\nWhen the President fired Comey early last month he wrote him a letter saying, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.”\n\nComey's associates have insisted in recent weeks that Comey would never have offered such assurances, even to the president, as a matter of principle. The FBI has confirmed publicly that it is conducting an investigation into Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, but it has not named names.\n\nThe New York Times first reported last month that Trump asked Comey to shut down the Flynn investigation. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Trump allegedly told Comey. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”\n\nTrump was asked directly at a press conference last month if he had \"in any way, shape or form\" asked Comey to \"back down the investigation into Michael Flynn,\" and he strongly denied it.\n\n\"No. No. Next question,\" Trump responded to the reporter.\n\nComey is scheduled to testify publicly for the first time since he was fired at a hearing in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee at 10 a.m. on Thursday.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>President Trump takes his seat during a meeting with the House and Senate leadership in the White House Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAlone in the White House in recent days, President Trump — frustrated and defiant — has been spoiling for a fight, according to his confidants and associates.\n\nGlued even more than usual to the cable news shows that blare from the televisions in his private living quarters, or from the 60-inch flat screen he had installed in his cramped study off the Oval Office, he has fumed about “fake news.” Trump has seethed as his agenda has stalled in Congress and the courts. He has chafed against the pleas for caution from his lawyers and political advisers, tweeting whatever he wants, whenever he wants.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the president will come screen-to-screen with the FBI director he fired, James B. Comey, thoughts of whom have consumed, haunted and antagonized Trump since Comey launched an expanding Russia investigation that the president slammed as a “witch hunt.”\n\nComey’s testimony is a political Super Bowl — with television networks interrupting regular programming to air it, and some Washington offices and bars making plans for special viewings.\n\nTrump is keen to be a participant rather than just another viewer, two senior White House officials said, including the possibility of taking to Twitter to offer acerbic commentary during the hearing.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\n“I wish him luck,” the president told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n“He’s infuriated at a deep-gut, personal level that the elite media has tolerated [the Russia story] and praised Comey,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich said. “He’s not going to let some guy like that smear him without punching him as hard as he can.”\n\nThis account of Trump’s mind-set and the preparations of his team in the run-up to Comey’s testimony is based on interviews with 20 White House officials, Trump friends and other well-connected Republicans, many of whom spoke only on the condition of anonymity to offer candid perspectives.\n\nThe president’s lawyers and aides have been urging him to resist engaging, and they hope to keep him busy Thursday with other events meant to compete for his — and the news media’s — attention.\n\n“The president’s going to have a very, very busy day,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. “I think his focus is going to be on pursuing the agenda and the priorities that he was elected to do.”\n\nAs of now, Trump’s Thursday morning — when Comey is scheduled to start testifying — is open. He plans to deliver a 12:30 p.m. speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s conference in Washington, followed by a 3:30 p.m. meeting with governors and mayors on infrastructure projects.\n\nJay Sekulow, a high-profile conservative lawyer in Washington, has met several times recently with Trump and said he found the president to have his attention squarely on his proposals.\n\n“He’s been very much in control and in command,” Sekulow said. “I don’t sense any siege or panic at all. . . . I’ve been there a lot, and I don’t see the president in any context distracted or flustered by any of this. I just don’t see it.”\n\nBut privately, Trump’s advisers said they are bracing for a worst-case scenario: that he ignores their advice and tweets his mind.\n\n“He’s not going to take an attack by James Comey laying down,” said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump friend and former political adviser. “Trump is a fighter, he’s a brawler and he’s the best counterpuncher in American politics.”\n\nThe president increasingly has come to see Twitter as his preferred method of communicating with his supporters, no matter the pitfalls.\n\n“The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning, making a reference to the “mainstream media.”\n\nThe West Wing, meanwhile, has taken on an atmosphere of legal uncertainty. White House counsel Donald F. McGahn has told staff to hold onto emails, documents and phone records, officials said, a move of caution designed to prepare the staff for future legal requests, should they come. McGahn has specifically advised staffers to avoid what are known as the “burn bags” in the executive branch that are often used to discard papers.\n\nWhile people familiar with the White House counsel’s office described McGahn’s moves as appropriate steps because of the ongoing probes, they said many junior staffers are increasingly skittish and fearful of their communications eventually finding their way into the hands of investigators.\n\nSome staffers nervous about their own personal liability are contemplating hiring lawyers and have become more rigorous about not putting things in text messages or emails that they would not want to be subpoenaed, one person familiar with the situation said.\n\nAttempting to invoke executive privilege to restrict Comey’s testimony was never seriously considered by Trump or his legal team, said one senior White House official. But, this official added, the White House liked floating the possibility as a distraction.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Comey’s testimony, the White House had privately tried to erect a war room that would handle the communications and legal strategies for responding to the Russia matter. Former Trump campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie were in discussions to lead it.\n\nBut the plan was scuttled, as with so much else in Trump’s administration, because of internal disagreements, according to multiple officials. Arguments included whether the war room would be run from inside or outside the gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.; who would staff it; whether they could be trusted by the president’s high-ranking advisers, or even trust one another; and whether Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s outside counsel, would ultimately control the message.\n\nKasowitz, who has a long-standing relationship with Trump, has been operating as an island of sorts in Trump world. He has been meeting regularly with the president and has a nascent relationship with McGahn, but he has not widely shared his legal strategy within the West Wing, according to two officials involved.\n\nKasowitz, whose combative personality mirrors Trump’s, has not found it easy to entice other big-name lawyers with Washington experience to join the cause because many prominent attorneys are reluctant to have him giving them direction and wonder whether he will be able to keep Trump from stumbling, one official said.\n\nIn the absence of a war room — and with the departure of communications director Michael Dubke — planning for the White House’s response to the Comey hearing has fallen largely to Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and his lieutenants.\n\nTrump’s team is preparing a campaign-style line of attack aimed at undercutting Comey’s reputation. They plan to portray him as a “showboat” and to bring up past controversies from his career, including his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2016, according to people involved in the planning.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has lined up a roster of surrogates to appear on conservative news stations nationwide to defend Trump. But a list the RNC distributed on Tuesday could hardly be described as star-studded: The names include Bob Paduchik, an RNC co-chair who worked on Trump’s Ohio campaign; Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R); and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge (R).\n\nTrump so far has been unable to recruit reinforcements for his beleaguered senior staff. Conversations about former Trump campaign official David Urban possibly joining the White House have stalled, although he remains in contact with several Trump advisers, officials said.\n\nThe White House has long struggled with its communications team, with Trump both privately and publicly voicing displeasure with his current staff. Press secretary Sean Spicer has started appearing less frequently on camera, and Trump and several top advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, are considering a range of options to revamp the structure.\n\nThe White House recently approached Geoff Morrell — who served as the Pentagon press secretary for more than four years under former defense secretary Robert Gates — about coming inside the administration and overhauling the communications operation, according to three people with knowledge of the overture.\n\nMorrell declined to comment, but BP announced last month that Morrell would be moving to London this summer to run government relations and communications for the company globally.\n\nScott Reed, senior political strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was also approached about taking a communications role within the White House, according to two people familiar with the outreach. Reed declined to comment.\n\nIn addition, Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk-radio host and Trump friend, discussed joining the White House but made clear to officials that she is more comfortable remaining outside as a vocal Trump ally because of her many broadcasting and media commitments, officials said.\n\nSome Trump loyalists outside the White House who are preparing to go on television news shows Thursday to defend the president and undermine Comey’s testimony said they have been given no talking points, nor seen any evidence of a strategy taking shape. One such loyalist said external supporters are afraid to coordinate too closely with the White House because they fear they could be accused of obstructing justice.\n\nTrump is personally reaching out to some allies on the Senate Intelligence Committee ahead of their questioning of Comey. He was scheduled to have dinner Tuesday night at the White House with Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), both committee members, along with a few other lawmakers. The dinner had been long scheduled for the president to offer a debrief on his foreign trip, a senior White House official said.\n\nIn the West Wing, people close to the president and junior aides fear that the president’s erratic behavior could have sweeping legal and political consequences, and they are beleaguered by how he has not proved able to concentrate fully on his agenda — this was supposed to be “infrastructure week,” for instance. Many are also resigned to the idea that there is little they can do to moderate or thwart Trump’s moves, so instead they are focused on managing the fallout.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House summed up the staff’s mantra as: “Please, don’t, you’re not helping things.”\n\nBut Trump and several political intimates see a political advantage to the president personally engaging, however unseemly it may appear to traditionalists.\n\n“He believes in the long run there is an enormous premium on being the person who stands there fighting,” said Gingrich, author of “Understanding Trump,” an upcoming book. “People respond to that and wonder if he’s fighting this hard, maybe he’s right and the other guys are wrong. It’s the core of how he operates.”\n\nAlan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and criminal law expert whose television commentary on the Russia probe has caught the White House’s attention, said he understands why the president would be motivated to speak out to counter Comey’s testimony.\n\n“Every lawyer would tell the president not to tweet, not to react,” Dershowitz said. “But he’s not listening. This is typical. I tell my clients all the time not to talk and they simply disregard it. It’d be very hard to tell a very wealthy, very powerful man not to tweet. He thinks, ‘I tweeted my way to the presidency,’ and he’s determined to tweet.”\n\nMary Jordan and Amber Phillips contributed to this report.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>His unwillingness to be alone with the president reflected how deeply Mr. Comey distrusted Mr. Trump, who Mr. Comey believed was trying to undermine the F.B.I.’s independence as it conducted a highly sensitive investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, the officials said. By comparison, Mr. Comey met alone at least twice with President Barack Obama.\n\nA spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on Mr. Comey’s request. A Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, said, “The attorney general doesn’t believe it’s appropriate to respond to media inquiries on matters that may be related to ongoing investigations.”\n\nThe Justice Department typically walls off the White House from criminal investigations to avoid even the appearance of political meddling in law enforcement. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly injected himself in law enforcement matters, and never more dramatically than in his private meetings with Mr. Comey.\n\n“You have the president of the United States talking to the director of the F.B.I., not just about any criminal investigation, but one involving his presidential campaign,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, who served in senior Justice Department roles during the Obama administration and is now a partner at the law firm Linklaters. “That is such a sharp departure from all the past traditions and rules of the road.”\n\nBut that raises one of the questions Mr. Comey will have to answer in his testimony on Thursday. If he believed that Mr. Trump was trying to get him to end an investigation, why did he not tell anyone about it?\n\nMr. Trump’s defenders note that Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director of the F.B.I., has said that “there has been no effort to impede our investigation.” Current and former law enforcement officials say Mr. Comey kept his interactions with Mr. Trump a secret in part because he was not sure whom at the Justice Department he could trust.\n\nF.B.I. officials were also unsure whether what Mr. Trump had done was a crime or how the conversation could be corroborated. So Mr. Comey kept the circle of officials at the F.B.I. who knew about his interactions with Mr. Trump small because he did not want agents and analysts working on the case to be influenced by what the president wanted.\n\nMr. Comey’s decision to keep his interactions with Mr. Trump a secret from the Justice Department were the latest example of how he set himself apart from the department throughout his tenure as F.B.I. director.\n\nSeveral times during the F.B.I.’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s personal email server last year, for example, Mr. Comey made decisions without the Justice Department’s knowledge or approval, often to the consternation of Loretta Lynch, then the attorney general. Mr. Comey has said he made those decisions — which have been praised and criticized along partisan lines — to protect the F.B.I.’s independence.\n\n“In a legal sense, we’re not independent of the Department of Justice,” Mr. Comey told Congress last month. “We are spiritually, culturally pretty independent group, and that’s the way you would want it.”\n\nMr. Comey is also likely to be asked Thursday what he told Mr. Trump about the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump has told aides and said publicly that, on three occasions, Mr. Comey assured him he was not under investigation.\n\nCurrent and former law enforcement officials said that when the investigation was handed over last month to a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Mr. Trump was not a target. But it is not clear what, if anything, Mr. Comey told the president about whether he was being investigated.\n\nWhile Justice Department policy allows officials to tell people whether they are the target of an investigation, prosecutors — not F.B.I. agents — handle such discussions. “We typically do not answer that question,” Mr. McCabe testified recently.\n\nFormer officials say Mr. Comey anticipated that the president might ask whether he was being investigated, and consulted his advisers on how to delicately sidestep the question. The officials were not aware of how Mr. Comey decided to answer.\n\nWhen the Justice Department transferred the Russia investigation to Mr. Mueller, it gave him the authority to investigate whether the president broke any laws by trying to obstruct the case or by firing Mr. Comey.\n\nAs F.B.I. director, Mr. Comey wrote a detailed memo after every major phone call or meeting with Mr. Trump and left the memos in the bureau’s files when he left. As special counsel, Mr. Mueller has access to those memos, but the F.B.I. declined a request from the Senate Intelligence Committee for copies, citing the ongoing investigation. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey still has copies of all of them or plans to read from them during his testimony.\n\nAccording to people briefed on the memos, they describe not only what Mr. Trump said, but also details such as his tone and where he was sitting. In one memo, Mr. Comey described a dinner with Mr. Trump at the White House a week after the inauguration in January. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to pledge his loyalty, but Mr. Comey refused.\n\nTwo weeks later, on Feb. 14, Mr. Trump kicked Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Sessions and other senior administration officials out of the Oval Office so he could have his one-on-one conversation with Mr. Comey, according to people briefed on one of Mr. Comey’s memos.\n\nIt was in that conversation that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to end the investigation into Mr. Flynn and encouraged him to investigate leaks, the people said.\n\n“I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey, according to the memo Mr. Comey wrote describing that meeting. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”\n\nAsked Tuesday about Mr. Comey’s coming testimony, Mr. Trump replied, “I wish him luck.”</p>",

                  "headline": "James Comey's testimony doesn't make the case for impeachment or obstruction against Donald Trump",
                  "text": "<p>In his opening statement, former FBI director James Comey said Trump requested 'loyalty' and urged him to drop the FBI's Michael Flynn investigation. The president's actions may have been wildly inappropriate, but they are not enough to establish a strong criminal case.\n\nThe release of former FBI director James Comey's testimony on Wednesday was received with the same breathless reactions that have long characterized coverage of the Russian investigation. CNN ran comments that the Comey testimony was nothing short of the Watergate tapes. The desire for some indictable or impeachable offense by President Trump has distorted the legal analysis to an alarming degree. Analysts seem far too thrilled by the possibility of a crime by Trump. The legal fact is that Comey's testimony does not establish a prima facie — or even a strong — case for obstruction.\n\nIt is certainly true that if Trump made these comments, his conduct is wildly inappropriate. However, talking like Tony Soprano does not make you Tony Soprano. Trump is not the first president to express dissatisfaction with an investigation by the Justice Department. Former president Bill Clinton made clear his own dissatisfaction with the investigations of his administration under then-Attorney General Janet Reno. It is no surprise that Trump wanted to see these investigations end. Indeed, he had a virtual hashtag to that effect.\n\nThe crime of obstruction of justice has not been defined as broadly as suggested by commentators. While there are a couple of courts with more expansive interpretations, the crime is generally linked to obstructing a pending proceeding as opposed to an investigation. Most courts have rejected the application of obstruction provisions to mere investigations. The manual used by federal prosecutors makes that same distinction. Even if a prosecutor was able to extend the definition of obstruction, there would remain the need to show that Trump sought to “corruptly” influence the investigation. Trump telling Comey that Michael Flynn is “a good guy,” and that he hoped Comey would let the matter drop is hardly a “cancer,” let alone a crime, growing on the presidency.\n\nFlynn had just resigned the day before Trump allegedly asked Comey whether he could now drop the investigation of Flynn. Trump had been told by Comey that he is not under investigation (three alleged confirmations by Comey that are equally inappropriate). Trump could say he felt Flynn had suffered enough. For a defense lawyer, a charge of obstruction on these facts would be a target-rich environment.\n\nThe mere fact that Trump asked to speak to Comey alone would not implicate the president in obstruction. Trump could argue that he sought to exclude Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others who were facing calls for recusal in the investigation. He could claim that he viewed this as a personal inquiry on behalf of a friend. He was, of course, wrong. Dead wrong in asking such a grossly improper question. However, to treat the desire of a private conversation as inescapable evidence of obstruction is to deny the obvious defenses in the case.\n\nIn the end, a prosecutor should never seek to indict a president absent a lead-pipe cinch of a case. This is no lead-pipe cinch. Of course, there is also the problem of actually indicting a sitting president if there was a crime and evidence to fit it. Many academics believe that a sitting president cannot be indicted. It remains an open question. After all, judges have faced indictment before impeachments. Yet, the president remains the head of the executive branch handling such prosecutions.\n\nThe proper course is for a president to be impeached and removed before any prosecution. It is no gift to a president. Impeachments are not subject to the rules of evidence or even the criminal code. Presidents can face a much broader array of evidentiary demands with far less protection under due process rules. A president can also be impeached for acts that are not technically crimes. Abuse of office is a classic example. However, analogies to Watergate show little understanding of those articles of impeachment. The first article against President Nixon was an obstruction allegation, but it was expressly linked to actual and serious crimes, including the criminal break-in at the Watergate. The article specifically listed an array of personal actions taken by Nixon and his subordinates to procure false statements, obstruct investigators, and “to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.”\n\nIronically, those who want a criminal charge on this record are committing the very offense that they accuse Trump of committing: disregarding the law to achieve their desired goal. It would be a highly dangerous interpretation to allow obstruction charges at this stage. If prosecutors can charge people at the investigation stage of cases, a wide array of comments or conduct could be criminalized. It is quite common to have such issues arise early in criminal cases. Courts have limited the crime precisely to avoid this type of open-ended crime where prosecutors could threaten potential witnesses with charges unless they cooperated.\n\nWe do not indict or impeach people for being boorish or clueless ... or simply being Donald Trump.\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

                  "text": "<p>The former FBI director is a giant of a man with an even bigger heart.\n\n“I wonder what her story is,” FBI Director James Comey said to no one in particular as our motorcade rolled through Lower Manhattan, past an elderly woman on a bench embracing a swaddled child.\n\n“Everyone has a story and I bet her story is incredible.”\n\nThis was not an unusual musing from our now departed leader — a giant of a man with an even bigger heart, whose focus was always on trying to understand and improve the lives of others.\n\n\nThis particular visit centered on a meeting in New York with counterterrorism officials. Afterward, rather than head back to the airport, Comey asked to be taken to the local FBI office so he could visit “the troops.” As the head of a deployed organization with offices nationwide, he would utilize any visit outside Washington to connect with our people. He walked the building floor by floor, meeting colleagues at their desks, extending his hand and offering a simple thank you for their service.\n\nTo say his firing jarred much of the FBI family would understate the varying levels of sadness, anger and confusion that followed the sudden dismissal of a man held in such high regard throughout American law enforcement. With the election and its aftermath consuming the national psyche, it may be hard to see past current headlines to reflect upon the incredible impact he had on our organization — but his legacy is a story worth telling.\n\nHow does one describe the impact someone like Comey had on the FBI? You start by doing something he would have shunned: highlighting his success. Like his predecessor, who faced and tackled challenges unique to his era, Comey took on growing problems within the organization in key areas such as leadership, agility and diversity. It might seem strange to call a respected leader a maniac, but Comey was nothing short of maniacal in driving change throughout the organization in order to right an off-axis leadership selection process, make the FBI more agile, and correct a major diversity problem.\n\nComey’s servant leadership principles were contagious and spread like wildfire throughout our organization. He purposefully populated our senior ranks with leaders who were kind but tough, confident yet humble. He cultivated a cadre of team-oriented field commanders who were not threatened by the notion that their subordinates might know more than they did.\n\nRealizing he himself could never stop improving, he fought to ensure he would not get trapped in a bubble devoid of varying perspectives, or become comfortable with the trappings of power. He got his own lunch, placed his own calls, and had zero patience for ego or arrogance. Any of our 36,000 employees could email him directly and he would respond. His servant leadership style was reflected in those who surrounded him: senior staff who shared his passion for the rule of law; junior staff like myself who never once felt hesitant to speak up to challenge him with a differing point of view; and, as would prove his most important picks, an accomplished deputy director and senior executives who are now successfully navigating us through transformational waters.\n\nConcerned the bureau was not as agile as it could be in adjusting to address emerging threats, Comey worked tirelessly to ensure that new ideas and inventive ways of doing business were not only accepted, but embraced. As he would passionately admonish new recruits during regular visits to the FBI Academy: “Do not let the grumpy old people crush your spirits! I’m a grumpy old person, and I can’t see us as freshly as you do. Study us and make us better.”\n\nComey looked at the organization and realized we soon risked a proverbial fall down the stairs. Our agent population had become increasingly white and change was needed. As he would say, not only is focusing on diversity the right thing to do, it is also an issue of effectiveness. If we do not accurately reflect the communities we serve, we risk being less effective. He assembled a machine of personnel and resources dedicated to attracting diverse talent. Indeed, his personal commitment to diversity was illustrated in the reason we flew 2,000 miles to Los Angeles on the day he was fired — so he could attend a diversity recruitment event and personally pitch talented young people on joining the FBI.\n\nWhen asked how he wanted to be remembered, Comey would quip that he wanted to be forgotten. He imagined finally getting us to a place where the solutions to our leadership, agility and diversity challenges were so ingrained in our culture, we would no longer remember even having a problem. Those of us shaped by him will tirelessly work to ensure his goals are achieved — although he will not soon be forgotten.\n\nIt’s strange writing about Comey in the past tense, because it feels like writing an obituary. In a way I am doing just that, because despite curious observations from outsiders regarding Comey’s standing among our FBI family, we are very much an organization in mourning. Fortunately for the FBI, his legacy of leadership and service will permeate our great institution for generations to come as the countless young leaders he touched rise in the organization. Although we must eventually move on and accept recent events — the security of the American people demands our focus on mission — many of us will never stop celebrating the legacy of our seventh director. Like the woman on the bench we passed that day in Manhattan, Director Comey has a story, and it’s incredible.\n\nJoshua Campbell is a special agent with the FBI who served as special assistant to former FBI director James Comey.

                  "headline": "I helped prosecute Watergate. Comey’s statement is sufficient evidence for an obstruction of justice case.",
                  "text": "<p>Philip Allen Lacovara, a former U.S. deputy solicitor general in the Justice Department, served as counsel to Watergate special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski.\n\nIn prepared testimony released on the eve of his appearance Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, former FBI director James B. Comey placed President Trump in the gunsights of a federal criminal investigation, laying out evidence sufficient for a case of obstruction of justice.\n\nComey proved what Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers carefully avoided admitting in their testimony on Wednesday — that the president had specifically attempted to shut off at least a major piece of what Trump calls the “Russia thing,” the investigation into the misleading statements by fired national security adviser Michael Flynn concerning his role in dealings with the Russians. This kind of presidential intervention in a pending criminal investigation has not been seen, to my knowledge, since the days of Richard Nixon and Watergate.\n\nComey’s statement meticulously detailed a series of interventions by Trump soliciting his assistance in getting the criminal probe dropped. These details are red meat for a prosecutor. Presumably, the team of experienced criminal prosecutors that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has assembled will be following up on this crucial testimony, which rests on contemporaneous memorandums that Comey was sufficiently alarmed to prepare immediately after receiving the president’s requests.\n\nThat both Coats and Rogers denied that they “felt pressured” provides no comfort for the president’s position. The obstruction of justice statute prohibits not only successful interference with pending criminal investigations but also any use of “threats” to “endeavor” to obstruct an investigation. Thus, it is the attempt or objective that is criminal, and Coats and Rogers were apparently unable to deny that the president had solicited their interference in the pending FBI investigation. If Coats and Rogers did not yield to the endeavor, kudos for them, but that is no excuse for the president.\n\nMoreover, Comey’s testimony also supplies the element of “threats.” He vividly describes a dinner with the president on Jan. 27, which the president surprisingly limited to just the two of them. The president asked Comey whether he liked his job and wanted to continue in it, even though, before the inauguration, the president had asked Comey to stay on the job, and Comey had eagerly accepted.\n\nLeaving little doubt about the price of continued retention, the president twice, according to Comey, told him that he expected “loyalty” from Comey, just as he did from everyone else around him.\n\nThen, on Feb. 14, the president carefully structured another one-on-one meeting with Comey, specifically ordering Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to whom the FBI director ordinarily reports, to leave the Oval Office where Comey, Sessions and other national security officials (and Jared Kushner) had been meeting. At that point, the president laid his cards on the table, according to Comey: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”\n\nNext, in phone calls on March 30 and April 11, the president solicited Comey’s help in removing the “cloud” over Trump resulting from the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump campaign collusion. The president again demanded loyalty: “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” He pressed Comey to make public statements exonerating the president, but Comey declined to do so.\n\nThe president dropped the other shoe on May 9, summarily firing Comey. The White House initially blamed this action on Comey’s actions during the 2016 campaign, but within the week Trump admitted that the cover story was a sham. He brazenly stated that he fired Comey in order to bring the “Russia thing” to a close, and he bragged to senior Russian officials in a private Oval Office meeting that this is what he thought that he had accomplished by sacking Comey.\n\nComey’s statement lays out a case against the president that consists of a tidy pattern, beginning with the demand for loyalty, the threat to terminate Comey’s job, the repeated requests to turn off the investigation into Flynn and the final infliction of career punishment for failing to succumb to the president’s requests, all followed by the president’s own concession about his motive. Any experienced prosecutor would see these facts as establishing a prima facie case of obstruction of justice.\n\nBut whether a sitting president may be indicted while in office is an open question. I advised the Watergate special prosecutors (and argued to the Supreme Court in the Nixon tapes case) that the president enjoys no unique immunity from obeying criminal laws. Other Justice Department officials, however, have taken a contrary position.\n\nThe ball now is in Mueller’s court to decide whether he has (or will have) enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction and, if so, whether to reach the same conclusion that I reached in the Nixon investigation — that, like everyone else in our system, a president is accountable for committing a federal crime.</p>",

                  "headline": "Trump lawyer says James Comey made ‘unauthorized disclosures’ of privileged talks",
                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON — While President Trump stayed unusually silent on James Comey, his lawyer stressed Thursday that Comey's testimony proved that Trump did not collude with Russia during last year's election nor try to obstruct justice in the FBI investigation — and went on to accuse the former FBI director of directing unauthorized news leaks designed to damage the president.\n\nComey’s testimony, attorney Marc Kasowitz said, \"makes clear that the president never sought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election.\"\n\n\"And in fact, according to Mr. Comey, the president told Mr. Comey 'it would be good to find out” in that investigation if there were “some ‘satellite’ associates of his who did something wrong.'\"\n\nIn attacking Comey's testimony — as Trump surrogates did throughout the day — Kasowitz said the ex-director \"admitted that he unilaterally and surreptitiously made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the president.\"\n\nTrump's lawyer was referring to the memos Comey kept on conversations he had with the president.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he moved to make aspects of his contemporaneous memos public by enlisting a friend to share contents of his own notes with a reporter, after the president suggested in a tweet there might be secret recordings of his conversations with Comey.\n\nComey said he hoped news reports would prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Indeed, the Justice Department appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia probe just one day after the existence of the memos was disclosed.\n\nYet Kasowitz said the New York Times reported on the memos before that presidential post. Calling Comey's action \"retaliatory,\" Kasowitz said that \"we will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated.\"\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that the Times quoted from Comey memos before Trump tweeted about possible \"tapes\" of their conversations in a post dated May 12. The first Times story on the memos appeared May 16.\n\nTrump himself discussed his \"privileged conversations\" with Comey during an interview with NBC News two days after his abrupt firing of the director on May 9.\n\nKasowitz's statement did not address Comey's testimony before the Senate panel that he kept notes out of concern that Trump might later lie about the nature of their conversations.\n\nComey said he began documenting his interactions with the president starting with his first meeting on Jan. 6 after a tense briefing at Trump Tower. “It was the subject matter and the person I was interacting with,\" he said. “It was the nature of the person. I was honestly concerned that he would lie about the nature of our meeting.\"\n\nIn the hearing, Comey also said Trump “defamed me and the FBI’’ after the president dismissed him last month. \"Those were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry the FBI workforce had to hear them, and the American people were told them,\" Comey said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Sarah Sanders declined comment on the former FBI director's testimony in general on Thursday, but she did dispute one key theme: \"I can definitely say the president is not a liar,\" Sanders said. \"It’s frankly insulting that that question would be asked.”\n\nAlso, Sanders also said she has \"no idea\" if there is a taping system in the White House, after Comey testified that he would welcome the release of any tapes of conversations he had with Trump.\n\nCritics of Trump, including Democratic lawmakers, said Comey's accounts and subsequent firing could add up to an effort by Trump to obstruct justice in an investigation of links between Trump campaign associates and Russians who tried to influence last year's election.\n\nComey said Trump repeatedly asked him to somehow resolve the Russia investigation, and pressed him to drop the inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\n\"He (Trump) described the Russia investigation as 'a cloud' that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country,\" Comey testified. Comey said he told the president that \"we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well.\"\n\nIn his written statement defending Trump, Kasowitz said the president \"never pressured Mr. Comey\" into dropping the Russia investigation, and never sought a loyalty oath from the FBI director.\n\nThe attorney did say that \"the Office of the President is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration,\" and that Trump has been betrayed by people leaking privileged information.\n\n\"It is now established that there the president was not being investigated for colluding with the or attempting to obstruct that investigation,\" Kasowitz said. \"As the committee pointed out today, these important facts for the country to know are virtually the only facts that have not leaked during the long course of these events.\"\n\nTrump watched parts of the hearing with top aides, including members of his legal team, in a private dining room at the White House.\n\nHe did not tweet about the Comey hearing, nor did he mention the testimony specifically during a midday speech to a group of religious conservatives. Trump did, however, tell supporters that \"we're under siege,\" and \"we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever.\"\n\nAs of mid-day Thursday, it had been more than 30 hours since Trump last tweeted.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn his testimony, Comey also essentially confirmed the president's claim that on three occasions the FBI director told the president he was not personally under investigation – statements Comey said Trump urged him to make public.\n\nIn his written statement, Comey said the FBI and Justice Department believed there were a number of reasons not to make that kind of statement publicly, \"most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.\"\n\nIn addition to the Comey hearing, Trump has had what spokesman Sean Spicer called \"a full day\" of presidential activity on Thursday.\n\nIt included the midday speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, and a mid-afternoon meeting with a group of mayors and governors to discuss infrastructure plans.\n\nTrump's focus, Spicer said, \"is going to be on pursuing the agenda and the priorities that he was elected to do.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2sYwsFL</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Former FBI director James B. Comey testified about his interactions with President Trump before the Senate Intelligence Committee June 8. Here are key moments. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nFired FBI director James B. Comey's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his conversations with President Trump on Russia can be summed up in one word: Newsworthy.\n\nHere are seven major takeaways.\n\n1. Comey is pretty sure Trump inappropriately interfered in the investigation — but Trump didn't ask the FBI to drop it entirely\n\nWhen asked if any official from the Trump administration had asked him to stop the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Former FBI director James B. Comey said \"no.\" (Reuters)\n\nThe way Comey understood his conversations with the president, Trump asked Comey for three things: His loyalty; to “lift the cloud” of perception the president was under investigation; and to drop the FBI's investigation into Trump's fired national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\n“The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation,” Comey said.\n\nBut, Comey testified, Trump did NOT ask him to drop the FBI's broader investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 election and whether Trump's campaign helped.\n\nComey also declined to give a legal judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice or colluded with Russia.\n\n2. Comey thinks the president is a liar\n\nAt the June 8 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, former FBI director James Comey said the Trump administration \"chose to defame\" him and the FBI after he was fired. (Video: Reuters)\n\nThe way Comey tells it, the first time he met Trump, he got the heebie-jeebies.\n\n“I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting,” Comey said, as to why he started writing memos of his meetings with the president. “I knew that there might come a day where I might need a record of what happened, not just to defend myself and FBI and the integrity of our situation, and the independence of our function.”\n\nComey also said the president lied about why he fired him:\n\n“The administration then chose to defame me — and, more importantly, the FBI — by saying the organization was in disarray and that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.”\n\n[Comey, unplugged]\n\n3. The way Trump handled Comey's firing prompted Comey to speak\n\nFormer FBI director James B. Comey said he has seen President Trump's May 12 tweet that suggested there could be \"tapes\" of their private conversations, saying \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes.\" (Reuters)\n\nFirst, Comey found out he was fired by watching TV.\n\nComey said he was confused about why he was fired. The president changed his narrative several times, ultimately settling on “that Russia thing.” Then, Comey read reports that the president told Russian officials that Comey was a “nut job.”\n\nFinally, Trump tweeted this:\n\nJames Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017\n\nComey said he and senior leaders in the FBI had decided to “keep … in a box” everything they had learned about the president's inappropriate questions about the investigation.\n\nBut after Trump's tweet, Comey said he couldn't stay silent.\n\n“I woke up in the middle of the night Monday [thinking] that there might be corroboration for our conversation,” Comey testified. “And my judgment was that I needed to get that out in the public square. So I asked a friend of mine to share the content of [my memos] with a reporter.”\n\nFormer FBI director James B. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee June 8 about why he helped reveal notes on his private talks with President Trump. (Reuters)\n\n4. Democrats are pretty sure Comey's firing is the key to what the president did wrong\n\n“I believe the timing of your firing stinks,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Comey's oversight of the Russia investigation \"might explain why you're sitting down as a private citizen.\"\n\nComey agreed that he thinks his firing was tied to the president's frustrations the Russia investigation.\n\n“Something about the way I was conducting, it created pressure, and he wanted me to leave,” Comey said.\n\n5. Republicans aren't trying to defend the president\n\nFormer FBI director James B. Comey says President Trump said he hoped Comey could let the Flynn investigation go. At a June 8 Senate Intelligence hearing, Comey told Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), that he \"took it as direction.\" (Reuters)\n\nThe closest they got was one GOP senator trying to argue that: Okay, what Trump did was wrong, but is it really obstruction of justice?\n\n“He said: 'I hope' [when he asked you to drop the Flynn investigation],\" said Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), a Trump ally. “You don't know of anyone that's ever been charged for hoping something?”\n\nComey said he didn't, but that he also took the president's comments as a directive.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) argued that Trump's request for Comey to \"lift the cloud\" by saying publicly the president was not under investigation was a reasonable one.\n\nComey agreed but said the president didn't seem to understand that the FBI would have to retract its public statement if Trump ever were under investigation.\n\n6. Republicans are critical of why Comey didn't speak up\n\n“The president never should have cleared the room,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) of a key Oval Office private meeting between Comey and Trump. “And he never should have asked you to let [the investigation into Flynn] go.\n\n“You could have said: 'Mr. President, this meeting is inappropriate. This response could compromise the investigation.'\"\n\nComey testified that he was “stunned” and, in retrospect, he probably should have been more firm with the president. But he just wanted to end the “awkward” conversations.\n\nComey said he doesn't regret keeping the president's conversations within a tight circle: \"No action was the most important thing I could do to make sure there was no interference in the investigation.\"\n\n7. No side comes off well in Comey's telling of events\n\n\n\nThen-U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nTo hear Comey tell it, when Republicans are in charge and the FBI was investigating Republicans, he was pressured by Republicans to shape his investigation.\n\nAnd when Democrats were in charge and he was investigating Democrats, he was pressured by Democrats. This is new and significant. It suggests that no side was above meddling.\n\nComey testified that when he was investigating Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch “directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it a matter.”\n\nThat, plus Lynch's private tarmac meeting with former president Bill Clinton ahead of the FBI's impending decision on whether Clinton may have criminally mishandled classified information, raised Comey's ethics radar and persuaded him to announce the FBI's findings ahead of schedule.\n\n“That was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude: I have to step away from the department if we're to close this case credibly,” Comey said.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Former FBI director James B. Comey testified about his interactions with President Trump before the Senate Intelligence Committee June 8. Here are key moments. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nPresident Trump’s declaration that the Thursday testimony of former FBI director James B. Comey was a “total and complete vindication” despite “so many false statements and lies” was the sort of brashly triumphant and loosely-grounded-in-reality statement we’ve come to expect from the commander in chief. It was news that came out a bit later, news about plans to file a complaint against Comey for a revelation he made during that Senate Intelligence Committee hearing meeting, that may end up being more damaging to the president.\n\nCNN and Fox first reported that Trump’s outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz, plans to file complaints with the inspector general of the Justice Department and the Senate Judiciary Committee about Comey’s testimony. At issue was Comey’s revelation that he provided a memo documenting a conversation with Trump to a friend to be shared with the New York Times.\n\nAs the news broke, I was on the phone with Stephen Kohn, partner at a law firm focused on whistleblower protection. We’d been talking about where the boundaries lay for Comey in what he could and couldn’t do with the information about his conversations with the president. Kohn’s response to the story about Kasowitz, though, was visceral.\n\n“Here is my position on that: Frivolous grandstanding,” he said. “First of all, I don’t believe the inspector general would have jurisdiction over Comey any more, because he’s no longer a federal employee.” The inspector general’s job is to investigate wrongdoing by employees of the Justice Department, which Comey is no longer, thanks to Trump — though the IG would have the ability to investigate an allegation of criminal misconduct.\n\n“But, second,” he continued, “initiating an investigation because you don’t like somebody’s testimony could be considered obstruction. And in the whistleblower context, it’s both evidence of retaliation and, under some laws, could be an adverse retaliatory act itself.”\n\nIn other words, Comey, here, is an employee who is blowing the whistle, to use the idiom, on his former boss. That boss wants to punish him for doing so. That’s problematic — especially if there’s no evidence that Comey actually violated any law that would trigger punishment.\n\nThis is where my original line of inquiry to Kohn comes back into play.\n\nFormer FBI director James B. Comey testified he used a third party to share the details of his private meetings with President Trump. When Sen. Blunt (R-Mo.) asked Comey why he didn't share the memos himself, Comey said he worried the media was camping at the end of his driveway and he thought it would \"be like feeding seagulls at the beach.\" (Reuters)\n\nComey testified under oath that, following a conversation with Trump in the Oval Office, he wrote a memo documenting what was said. Last month, he provided that memo to a friend and asked that it be shared with the New York Times.\n\nThat, as described, is not illegal, Kohn said.\n\n“Obviously you can report on a conversation with the president,” he said. “What the president does isn’t confidential or classified.” There is the principle of “executive privilege,” which protects the president’s deliberative process as he does his job. But that wouldn’t cover a conversation like the one between Comey and Trump.\n\nIn a piece he wrote for The Post on Thursday, Kohn described a 2003 case involving Robert MacLean, an air marshal who was fired for leaking information about a Homeland Security Department decision. That case established a relevant precedent for the Comey question. The Supreme Court determined that the DHS rule prohibiting leaks was insufficient cause for firing in the whistleblower context, since it wasn’t a law. By extension, even if Trump tried to argue that Comey violated executive privilege, that, too, is not codified in law.\n\nIf the information in that memo Comey gave to his friend was classified, the situation changes. But in his testimony, Comey described how he protected classified information in memos he wrote documenting conversations. There’s no indication, despite Trump’s lawyer’s cleverly worded statement on Thursday, that Comey crossed that important legal line.\n\nComey gave nonclassified notes about a conversation he had with the president to a friend with the express purpose of releasing that information to the media. In Kohn’s eyes, there’s nothing remotely illegal about that — making the new “frivolous grandstanding” from Kasowitz particularly problematic.\n\n“The constitutional right to go to the press with information on matters of public concern, as long as you’re not doing it in a way that will bring out classified information,” Kohn said, “the reason why that is protected constitutionally is that the courts — including the U.S. Supreme Court — have ruled that the public has a constitutional right to hear this information.” In other words, it’s constitutionally protected speech.\n\nTrying to get DOJ to go after Comey –a material witness– over \"leak\" is yet more obstruction of Justice. — Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) June 9, 2017\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Trump’s tweeted attacks on the veracity of Comey’s testimony are also unlikely to bear much fruit. Making a mistake in testimony is not in itself illegal. When Comey made such a mistake last month, the FBI corrected his statement after the fact. Perjury requires a demonstration of intent, that the person meant to lie. That would be a difficult case to make legally.\n\nWe can safely assume, though, that Trump’s team is aware that Comey likely didn’t violate any laws, and that they are simply using these arguments as a tool for undermining the parts of his testimony that they didn’t like. How they’re doing it, though, could make their problems worse.\n\nKohn summarized the new minefield into which Trump and his lawyer might be walking.\n\n“They know that they’re not going to get anything out of Comey on this, because there’s no evidence,” he added. “But they’re clearly trying to create a chilling effect. Not a chilling effect on classified information. … This is a chilling effect on people not to talk about conversations they had with the president that are not classified as a matter of law.”\n\nUpdate:\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. Tom Devine, legal director for the Government Accountability Project pointed out in an email after this article was originally published that Comey himself isn’t covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act since he was both a presidential appointee and a representative of the FBI, a position which doesn’t fall under the act’s purview.\n\nDevine thinks, though, that another federal law may apply to Comey. U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1513 makes it a federal offense for anyone who “with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense.” Whether or not Comey is an actual witness in a federal investigation is the key question here; given the uniqueness of the circumstances, there is a lot of fuzziness.\n\nWhether or not Trump and his team would like to punish Comey for his testimony seems more straightforward.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Mr. Trump’s default defiance masked a deep anxiety and anger, described by people close to him in recent days, that are anything but typical for even the most disruptive of presidents. But that eventually gave way to a sense of relief, however temporary, as Mr. Comey confirmed the president’s insistence that Mr. Comey had repeatedly told him that he was not personally under investigation in the inquiry into Russian election interference.\n\nIn all, Mr. Trump watched only about 45 minutes of Mr. Comey’s testimony, the people close to the president said. Much of that time was spent under the eye of his take-charge personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, one of the cabinet members he trusts most.\n\nThis was by design, with the president’s tacit consent. His aides packed the day with meetings and speechwriting sessions, including a 90-minute sit-down focusing on North Korea, Qatar and the terrorist attacks in Iran with the national security adviser, H. R. McMaster; Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; and Mr. Mattis.\n\nThe idea: Keep Mr. Trump occupied, even-keeled and away from Twitter.\n\nMr. Trump, according to two people in his orbit, was preoccupied, uncharacteristically impassive but in generally decent spirits. Most of his aides studiously avoided the topic of the hearing, under instruction from Mr. Kasowitz, who is trying to close the circle of decision-making on the matter and stem a tide of leaks.\n\nMr. Trump’s aides were also acutely conscious of treading lightly to avoid agitating the president, who has been in a sour and combative mood all week, according to two people close to the president.\n\nThe president was uncharacteristically disciplined, leaving for his speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition event sharply at noon, even while Mr. Comey’s hearing had 30 more minutes to go. Mr. Trump breezed out of the Oval Office without any expression of interest in lingering.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The president, who is prone to murmuring while watching television, said at least once that he had been right about the Hillary Clinton email investigation — Mr. Comey said he had been uncomfortable when Ms. Lynch asked him to refer to the criminal inquiry as a “matter” — as well as that Mr. Comey was a self-promoter.\n\nHis top advisers, especially his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, were worried that the president would defy Mr. Kasowitz and take to Twitter to vent his pique with Mr. Comey, who he believes is on a personal mission to destroy his presidency. West Wing staff members expressed relief when the president’s Twitter feed remained quiet even after Mr. Comey accused him of telling “lies, plain and simple,” in an effort to smear his reputation and that of the bureau.\n\nThe relief, they fear, might be short-lived. Aides were bracing for some kind of Twitter eruption on Thursday night or early Friday. Aides expected the president to either watch the full hearing later in the day on TiVo, or — potentially worse — simply skip to coverage on Fox News or CNN, where Mr. Comey’s most damaging comments were playing on a loop.\n\nThe mood in the West Wing, which has taken on an increasingly apprehensive edge as the Russia investigation has intensified, was especially tense on Thursday as Mr. Comey spoke, despite a claim by a Trump spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in an off-camera briefing at midday that “it’s a regular Thursday at the White House.”\n\nStaff members gathered around TV sets and winced at Mr. Comey’s statements, but shifted immediately when Mr. Comey, to their surprise, revealed that he had fed a memo to The New York Times through an intermediary to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nMr. Trump’s team was equally surprised, and encouraged, when Mr. Comey questioned Ms. Lynch’s actions in the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server. Ms. Lynch asked him to call it a “matter” to protect Mrs. Clinton, a fellow Democrat, Mr. Comey suggested.\n\nBut the sugar highs of Mr. Trump’s early days in office have subsided, and there was no high-fiving or expressions of relief. Staff members, especially in the beleaguered White House press office, have become suspicious that leakers might relay their comments to reporters, and Mr. Kasowitz has met with many top staff members to advise them against discussing issues facing the president, even relatively innocuous ones, telling one aide, “Leave everything to me.”\n\nFor their part, many of Mr. Trump’s aides were less than impressed by the public performance of Mr. Kasowitz, a lawyer based in New York who has earned the president’s respect and, for the moment, his situational obedience. A hastily drafted initial statement to the news media contained typos — “president” was misspelled — and he delivered it in a harried monotone, staring down at his text, to reporters gathered at the National Press Club.\n\nGradually, however, the concerns of any single news cycle are giving way to longer-term worries about the course of the investigation, and several West Wing aides have expressed concern about the possibility of being blindsided by new revelations.\n\nSeveral current and former Trump aides said they were especially concerned about Mr. Kasowitz’s unqualified assertion that the president had “never told Mr. Comey, ‘I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,’” as Mr. Comey said on Thursday.\n\n“I can’t believe they are worried about public opinion on a day like this, when Comey set so many perjury traps for them,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a veteran Democratic operative who served as Mrs. Clinton’s communications director during the 2016 campaign.\n\n“Communications and news cycles don’t matter — they don’t know what is going to hit them,” added Ms. Palmieri, who served in the White House during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. “They are still telling the president what he wants to hear, and that’s extraordinarily dangerous.”</p>",

I will tell you, I didn't say that,\" he told ABC News' chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl about the Flynn investigation claims.\n\n\"And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I read today but I did not say that,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked about the alleged loyalty pledge, Trump denied ever having made such a move.\n\n\"I hardly know the man.

I hardly know the man,\" Trump said.\n\nAt a different point during the news conference, Trump said he would \"100 percent\" be willing to testify under oath, and went on to criticize Comey's testimony.\n\n\"In the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He's a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country. Jobs, trade deficits. We want them to disappear fast. North Korea, big problem. Middle East, a big problem,\" Trump said.\n\n\"So that's what I am focused on. That's what I have been focused on. But yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction. We are doing very well. It's almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole east coast and win everything as a Republican and that's what we did. So it was just an excuse. But we were very, very happy and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said and some of the things that he said just weren't true,\" he said.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump on Friday disputed his former Federal Bureau of Investigation director’s statements about their conversation regarding the agency’s probe of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, laying the groundwork for a potential legal clash that could have far-reaching consequences.\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden, a day after former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had urged him to ease off the agency’s probe of Mr. Flynn, Mr. Trump said he would be willing to similarly testify under oath that he didn’t do so.\n“I didn’t say that. I will tell you I didn’t say that,” Mr. Trump said at a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. “And there’d be nothing wrong if I did say it, according to everything I’ve read today.” He said he would be “100%” willing to testify under oath to that effect and that he would also consent to be interviewed by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Trump associates’ ties to Russia.\n\nMr. Trump’s comments were part of a broader counterattack launched Friday by the president and his allies against Mr. Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\nThe president broke his Twitter silence Friday to call that testimony a “total and complete vindication” of him on the bureau’s Russia investigation because Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump wasn’t under personal investigation. His allies also sought to raise questions about Mr. Comey’s credibility.\n\nMr. Trump’s private attorney, Marc Kasowitz, plans to file a complaint early next week with the Justice Department inspector general and to send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, a person close to the president’s legal team said, following Mr. Comey’s acknowledgment Thursday that he passed his notes about his conversations with the president to a friend after his firing and authorized that friend to release them to a reporter.\nBut the intensifying showdown between Mr. Comey and Mr. Trump carries steep risks as it is providing new leads for the investigators inside the FBI and on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee on Friday asked the White House counsel to detail whether any tapes existed of conversations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey in the White House—something that Mr. Trump alleged in a tweet earlier this year.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer, asked when the president might comment on whether tapes exist, shook his head and said: “When he’s ready.”\nAt the news conference, Mr. Trump said he would comment in the “near future” on the existence of any recordings of his private conversations.\n\nPressed whether he was hinting that there were in fact tapes, Mr. Trump responded: “I’m not hinting anything. I’ll tell you about it over a very short period of time.” He added: “Oh, you’re going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, don’t worry.”\nMr. Comey said in his testimony Thursday, “Lordy, I hope there are tapes.”\nThe House Intelligence Committee asked Mr. Comey in a Friday letter to turn over any notes or memorandums concerning his discussions with the president. A bipartisan group of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee also asked Columbia University professor Daniel Richman to turn over any copies of memos in his possession. Mr. Comey testified this week that he gave his memos to a friend, who was later identified as Mr. Richman, as a way to leak them to the media.\n\nAnd Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and the president’s son-in-law, is expected to meet privately with Senate Intelligence Committee staff this summer to answer questions related to the committee’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a White House official said Friday.\nMr. Kushner is in talks with the committee about a specific date, the official said.\n\n\nThe stream of new developments and the president’s denials and comments only heightened attention on the investigation that White House aides have been trying to drive out of the headlines.\nThe Rose Garden event was intended to showcase Mr. Trump’s commitment to North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in Europe, which the president did, but that theme was smothered by the discussion about the Russia probe.\nIn addition to denying any attempt to block the Flynn investigation, Mr. Trump also said he hadn’t told Mr. Comey that he expected his loyalty, as the former FBI director testified Thursday. “I hardly know the man. I’m not going to say, ‘I want you to pledge allegiance,’” Mr. Trump said. “It hardly makes sense.”\n\nMr. Trump also reiterated comments he made on Twitter earlier Friday that Mr. Comey’s testimony had “vindicated” him, saying it showed that there was “no collusion” between him and Russia and “no obstruction.” He added: “James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren’t true.”\nIn his testimony, Mr. Comey confirmed Mr. Trump’s claims that he had, during his time as FBI director, told the president he wasn’t personally the subject of the FBI investigation. However, he said that knowledge extended only to May 9, the day the president fired him.\n\nLawyers and members of Congress have expressed skepticism that Mr. Comey, now a private citizen, could be prosecuted for leaking. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), asked about the prospect on Thursday, said of Mr. Comey: “Once you’re no longer working for the government, I mean, I suspect that’s his prerogative.”\nJohn Dean, former White House counsel under President Richard Nixon, said in a CNN interview Thursday that there are no restrictions on private citizens discussing meetings they have held with the president.\nMr. Trump’s reaction reflects the mixed nature of Mr. Comey’s testimony. Mr. Comey made clear that Mr. Trump wasn’t a target of the Russia probe, backing Mr. Trump’s statements to that effect. But Mr. Comey also recounted several occasions where he said he felt Mr. Trump was trying to pressure him on the investigation or threaten his independence.\nIn his testimony, Mr. Comey declined to offer his opinion on whether he thought Mr. Trump was trying to obstruct justice, but he said that issue is something that the recently appointed special counsel would examine.\nMr. Comey’s public testimony lasted more than 2 1/2 hours and allowed the former FBI chief to speak publicly on a range of topics surrounding his interactions with the president, including his decision to document all conversations with the president because he believed Mr. Trump “might lie” about them later.\nThursday’s hearing made clear Mr. Comey believed the president had actively tried to influence the course of the FBI’s investigation into Mr. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, who was forced to resign after making false statements about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But because the most damning accounts involved one-on-one encounters with the president—and Mr. Trump disputes Mr. Comey’s version—investigators face a challenge as they examine the matter.\n\n“It’s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Mr. Comey said.\nFollowing his remarks in the Rose Garden Friday, Mr. Trump boarded Marine One to head to his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., for the weekend, ignoring shouted questions about the alleged Oval Office tapes.\n—Byron Tau contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Carol E.

                  "text": "<p>Russian president’s yearly question-and-answer event included comments on the former FBI director and a phone call from Arizona about ‘Russophobia’\n\nVladimir Putin made a sarcastic offer of asylum to former FBI director James Comey on Thursday, during an attack on Comey’s claims of Russian interference in the US election.\n\n“It sounds very strange when the head of the security services writes down a conversation with the commander-in-chief and then leaks it to the media through his friend,” said Putin. “How, in that case, does he differ from [Edward] Snowden?” the Russian president asked, referring to the NSA whistleblower who has been given political asylum in Russia.\n\n“That means he is not the leader of the security services, but a human rights defender. And if he faces pressure, then we are happy to offer him political asylum too,” said Putin.\n\nSpeaking during a marathon phone-in session with the Russian people, Putin said he had not followed Comey’s testimony to the Senate intelligence committee last week but knew some of the details. “The former FBI director said there was Russian interference in the US election process but again gave no evidence,” said Putin.\n\nUS intelligence agencies believe Russian hackers attacked the Democratic party’s servers with the aim of helping Donald Trump get elected.\n\nPutin accused the US of interfering in countries across the world by financing NGOs, and said many world leaders had complained about this to him but were scared of saying it publicly for fear of angering Washington.\n\n“As for us, we have our opinion, we say it openly, but it’s not some kind of underground sabotage activity.”\n\nPutin said it was important to find dialogue with the US to help solve global issues such as fighting poverty and radicalism, and said he was “ready for constructive dialogue” with Trump.\n\nPutin is due to meet Trump for the first time on the sidelines of the G20 summit in early July, but Moscow’s hopes of a new start to relations under Trump have been overshadowed by the allegations of Russian interference in the election and potential collusion with elements of the Trump campaign.\n\nThe phone-in also included a video address from an American man in Arizona, who said he was a friend of Russia and asked Putin for advice on how to fight the “racist Russophobia” he said had taken hold in the US.\n\n“I don’t think I have the right to give you any advice, but I want to thank you for your position, and we know that we have a lot of friends in the United States,” said Putin.\n\nAn annual fixture on Putin’s calendar, the televised question-and-answer session is carefully choreographed, and mainly features Russians asking the president to help with local issues.\n\nThe hosts said there had been more than 2 million questions submitted in advance of the phone-in, which if true would mean that more than 1% of all Russians had submitted questions, a sign that many see Putin as the only person that can solve their problems.\n\nThe program featured Putin ticking off a regional governor for a delay in housing payments, and promising to investigate why a Siberian teacher had such a low salary. He also resolved to sort living conditions for residents who live near a landfill site outside Moscow, and help with access to medicine for a young disabled woman.\n\nThe phone-in also went live to a group of singing shamans on Siberia’s Lake Baikal, an oath ceremony for army conscripts in Volgograd, and to a maternity ward in the city of Ufa, where a man whose wife had given birth minutes previously spoke live to Putin, cradling the infant in his arms.\n\nHe was also asked the weight of the biggest fish he ever caught (20kg) and what era he would visit if he had a time machine (the second world war). He dodged an oblique question about whether he would still be president at the time of the next phone-in. Presidential elections are due in March next year, and Putin is widely expected to stand and win but has not officially announced his candidacy.\n\nOliver Stone on Vladimir Putin: ‘The Russian people have never been better off’ Read more\n\nPutin spoke only briefly and obliquely about the opposition protests that swept Moscow and other Russian cities on Monday, organised by opposition politician and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. Asked if he would be willing for dialogue with the opposition, Putin said he would talk to people who really wanted to improve people’s lives, but not those who “use the difficulties we have for their own political PR”. Putin has never referred to Navalny by name in public.\n\nUnusually, a graphic that appeared on the bottom right of the screen during the phone-in featured written questions often differing sharply in tone to those that were asked out loud.\n\nThey included: “Goodbye Vladimir Vladimirovich,” “Is it true that Navalny is making a film about you,” and “Putin, do you really think that people believe in this circus with staged questions?”\n\nIt was unclear if the questions were allowed onto the air deliberately, or due to a production error.</p>",

                  "text": "<p> WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump said he had a secret.\nHe dangled it on Twitter. He parried reporters’ questions about it. He milked the moment, drawing out the drama for weeks. That big tease played out in 2011, when Trump promised to reveal what his private investigators had found in Hawaii about President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. (Trump never did release anything.)\nNow, Trump has stretched out a new high-stakes guessing game, this time in the White House, by hinting that he might have recordings of his conversations with fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nTrump is expected to answer the tapes question this week.\n\nIf they do exist, they could become a central piece of evidence in the Russia investigation that has transfixed Washington and cast a shadow over the future of Trump’s presidency. If they don’t, questions will be raised about why the president would stake his reputation and political capital on promoting something that just isn’t real.\nSeveral outside advisers who speak to Trump regularly said the president has not mentioned the existence of tapes during their conversations. White House aides have been known to grimace when the subject comes up, and more than a half-dozen staffers said they were unaware of any recording devices. All demanded anonymity to speak about private discussions with the president.\n\nWhether the tapes exist or not, this is far from the first time that Trump, the former star of reality TV and tabloids, has manufactured a melodrama that begins with bluster but often ends with a whimper.\n“I think he was in his way instinctively trying to rattle Comey,” says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime Trump confidant. “He’s not a professional politician. He doesn’t come back and think about Nixon and Watergate. His instinct is: ‘I’ll outbluff you.’”\n\nThe latest chapter in Trump’s tale of mystery began last month, just days after he fired Comey, then leading the investigation into contacts between the president’s campaign and Russian officials.\nA New York Times report cited two unnamed Comey associates who recounted his version of a January dinner with the president in which Trump asked for a pledge of loyalty. Comey declined, instead offering to be “honest.” When Trump then pressed for “honest loyalty,” Comey told him, “You will have that,” the associates said.\nTrump tweeted the next day that Comey “better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!”\n\nThat immediately evoked the secret White House recordings that led to Richard Nixon’s downfall during Watergate. Under a post-Watergate law, the Presidential Records Act, recordings made by presidents belong to the people and can eventually be made public. Destroying them would be a crime.\nComey has claimed that any recordings would support his claims that Trump asked him to pledge loyalty and to drop the investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser.\n\n“Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Comey declared at a congressional hearing.\n\nBut the president has steadfastly refused to clarify whether any tapes exist.</p>\n\nTwo weeks ago, he teased reporters in the White House Rose Garden by saying that he’d explain “maybe sometime in the very near future.” He cryptically added: “You are going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer.” White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said Wednesday that an answer would be provided this week, presumably by the Friday deadline set by the House intelligence committee for turning over any tapes.\nTrump’s private counsel, Marc Kasowitz, would not be involved in the handover of any tapes, his spokesman said. A White House spokesman did not respond to a question on whether White House counsel Don McGahn would have a role.\n\nThe Secret Service has no audio copies or transcripts of any tapes recorded within Trump’s White House, according to a freedom of information request submitted by The Wall Street Journal. But that doesn’t exclude the possibility that recordings were created by another entity.\n\nAt his office in New York, Trump was known to worry about possible listening devices, but he also occasionally taped his own phone conversations. Some campaign workers also believed Trump had a system set up to record phone calls.\nTrump has a long history of making outsized claims. In the 1980s, he got ensnarled in a battle over a valuable tract of property on Manhattan’s west side he dubbed “Television City,” claiming without proof that major TV networks had promised to build there, according to George Arzt, press secretary for then-Mayor Ed Koch. The project never was built.\n“This is all about gamesmanship for him,” said Arzt. “It doesn’t matter what the outcome of the gamesmanship is. He’s a showman and it keeps him in the headlines. There haven’t been repercussions if his bluff fails.”\n\nTrump flirted with presidential runs in 1988 and 2000 before abandoning them. He offered to help rebuild the World Trade Center in 2004 but never followed through. And his embrace of birtherism, which questioned whether Obama was born in the United States and eligible to become president, fueled his political rise. He claimed to have sent investigators to Hawaii and teased their possible findings for months, but never produced any evidence.\n\nThe pattern has continued since his election.\n\nSometimes he’s delivered on the tease: He spent weeks building suspense about whether the United States would remain in the Paris climate agreement and eventually announced in a lavish Rose Garden ceremony that the U.S. would pull out.\n\nBut other times he has not. On New Year’s Eve, he claimed he knew “things that other people don’t know” about foreign hacking of last year’s election, and that the information would be revealed “on Tuesday or Wednesday.” Those days came and went without an answer. In March, he tweeted the incendiary claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor, a charge he’s never supported.\n“He follows the paradigm that no news is bad news,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide. “He knows how to play to America’s insatiable appetite not just for news but for drama and interest. He brought that to Washington: you have a mogul sitting in the White House and he’s going to keep doing it his way.”\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ken Thomas and Deb Riechmann contributed reporting.\n\n",

                  "text": "<p>The weekend before he fired FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump drafted a letter to him laying out the reasons why he didn’t want him to stay in the job, a senior Trump administration official said Friday.\nMr. Trump, who worked on the draft at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., in early May, wanted Mr. Comey to publicly state the president wasn’t personally under investigation in connection to Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election—an assurance the director had previously given the president privately, a person familiar with the matter said.\nParaphrasing the letter, the administration official said Mr. Trump wanted this message sent: “You’ve told me three times I’m not under investigation but you won’t tell the world, and it’s hampering the country.”\n\nMr. Comey, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, confirmed that during his stint at the FBI, Mr. Trump wasn’t under investigation. The president’s actions—including firing Mr. Comey—are now being examined by special counsel Robert Mueller, who took over the Russia probe after the FBI director was fired on May 9.\n\nMr. Trump sought to take action because he saw the lingering investigation as a weight on his presidency, underscored by conversations with some foreign leaders who would bring up the Russia probe, according to the administration official. The president wrote the four-page letter with the help of a senior White House aide, Stephen Miller.\n“It was the president’s ideas. Miller was the scrivener,” the administration official said.\n\nUltimately, the letter was never sent to Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump instead shared the draft with various White House aides and gave it to top Justice Department officials in a meeting at the White House on Monday, May 8, the official said.\nThe next day, Mr. Trump sent Mr. Comey a four-paragraph letter telling him he had been fired, invoking letters he had received from the Justice Department leadership citing damage the former director had done to the FBI’s credibility during an investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email practices.\n\nLast month, with the White House’s consent, the Justice Department turned over the draft letter to Mr. Mueller, two administration officials said. The New York Times  on Friday first reported on the letter.\n\nOne part of Mr. Mueller’s probe is whether the president obstructed justice in firing Mr. Comey. The administration official said nothing in the letter suggests the president wanted to scuttle the entire Russia investigation, which is also examining foreign hacks of political parties and the spread of false news stories damaging to Mrs. Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump drafted the letter just days after Mr. Comey’s testimony to Congress on May 3 defending his handling of the Clinton email investigation in 2016.\n\nMr. Trump was “offended” by the testimony, and complained about an “arrogance” shown by Mr. Comey that wasn’t appropriate given his position, the administration official said.\n“It makes me mildly nauseous to think we might have had some impact on the election” won by Mr. Trump last November, Mr. Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee in May. “But honestly, it wouldn’t change the decision.”\nThe next day, a Thursday, Mr. Trump asked top aides about firing Mr. Comey, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nOn Friday May 5, just before leaving for his Bedminster golf course, Mr. Trump dressed down two of his top aides—White House counsel Don McGahn and Steve Bannon, then his chief strategist—over Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ decision, two months earlier, to recuse himself from the Russian investigation.\n\nWhite House reporters captured part of the argument on camera, including a video shot from outside the windows of the Oval Office that showed Mr. Bannon pointing and shouting.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted the next day that he was at his golf course, because it was too “expensive and disruptive” to return to Trump Tower in Manhattan. “Meetings!” he wrote on Twitter .\nAides said the Bedminister trip was mostly supposed to include time for golf and relaxation. The weather didn’t cooperate, and Mr. Trump continued to be bothered by Mr. Comey’s testimony. By Sunday, he was working up the letter with Mr. Miller and other aides.\n\nOn May 8, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, shared his own concerns about Mr. Comey’s leadership with the president at the White House. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Rosenstein to detail his assessments in a memo.\nThe president fired Mr. Comey the following day, and the White House initially portrayed the Rosenstein memo as the central reason for the dismissal.\n\nIn response to that characterization, the deputy attorney general issued strong objections and pressed the White House to correct the record, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nBy the end of the week, Mr. Trump acknowledged in an interview with NBC News that he had intended to fire Mr. Comey, regardless of the memo from the deputy attorney general.\n\n“When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘you know, this Russia thing, with Trump and Russia, is a made-up story,’” Mr. Trump said in an interview with NBC News. “It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.”\n\nWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Michael C.

                  "text": "<p>The Justice Department should consider prosecuting former FBI director James B. Comey for actions that “were improper and likely could have been illegal,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday.\n\n“I think if there's ever a moment where we feel someone's broken the law, particularly if they're the head of the FBI, I think that's something that certainly should be looked at,” Sanders said.\n\nShe said that recommending such a prosecution is “not the president's role,” and that the White House is not encouraging it.\n\n“That's the job of the Department of Justice, and something they should certainly look at,” Sanders said.\n\nAsked to clarify, Sanders said this:\n\n“Anybody that breaks the law, whatever that process is that needs to be followed, should certainly be looked at,” Sanders said. “If they determine that that's the course of action to take, then they should certainly do that, but I'm not here to ever direct DOJ in — in the actions that they should take.”\n\nNonetheless, Sanders ticked through a list of actions or alleged actions by Comey that she said justified his firing by Trump, in May, and some of which, she said, may be illegal.\n\n“The president is proud of the decision that he made. The president was 100 percent right in firing James Comey. He knew at the time that it could be bad for him politically, but he also knew and felt he had an obligation to do what was right, and do what was right for the American people, and certainly the men and women at the FBI,” Sanders said at a White House press briefing.\n\n“I think there's no secret. Comey, by his own self-admission, leaked privileged government information weeks before President Trump fired him. Comey testified that an FBI agent engaged in the same practice, they'd face serious repercussions,” Sanders continued. “I think he set his own stage for himself on that front. His actions were improper, and likely could have been illegal.”\n\nComey leaked memos to the New York Times, and “politicized an investigation by signaling he would exonerate Hillary Clinton before he ever interviewed her or other key witnesses,” Sanders added. She also asserted that Comey had given false testimony to Congress.\n\nTrump has complained that Comey let Clinton off the hook last year when the FBI closed an investigation into the handling of classified information on the private email server Clinton used as secretary of state. Comey said Clinton had been sloppy, but had not acted criminally. The announcement came days after Clinton was interviewed by the FBI, and Comey critics have alleged that he had already decided to shutter the investigation before going through the formality of interviewing her.\n\nComey has maintained that he acted lawfully in preserving notes from meetings with Trump that he testified had made him uncomfortable, and acknowledged that he allowed accounts of the meetings drawn from those notes to become public.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. A lawyer for Comey did not immediately comment.\n\nSanders' comments left unclear what federal law she thought the former FBI director might have violated. She mentioned the disclosure of a memo by Comey to a law professor friend, but at the time that happened the memo was not classified.\n\nShe also cited his apparent preparation of remarks explaining his decision not to charge anyone in the case months before that decision was announced, and before Clinton herself had been interviewed about the matter. It was unclear from Sanders' comments what about that conduct might constitute a crime.\n\nReporters had asked Sanders about comments from former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who told \"60 Minutes” that canning Comey may have been the worst political mistake in “modern political history,” since it led to the creation of a special counsel to investigate potential ties between Russia and Trump's campaign.\n\n-Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.</p>",

Ricardo Rosselló told reporters Monday.\n\n\"The eye and the intense inner core is expected to pass near Dominica during the next few hours,\" the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. advisory. \"Maria is likely to affect Puerto Rico as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and a hurricane warning has been issued for that island.\"\n\nMaria packed sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kilometers per hour), bringing the chance of life-threatening storm surge, the advisory said, accompanied by \"large and destructive waves,\" and \"hitting the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.\"\n\nA US Air Force Reserve C-130 Hurricane Hunter took off from Curacao and is scheduled to arrive in Maria later on Monday, the hurricane center said. It is \"distinctly possible\" that aircraft data show a higher intensity, forecasters said.\n\n\"Maria is developing the dreaded pinhole eye,\" a very small, perfect inner core of a very intense hurricane, the center said.\n\nForecasters predict mudslides caused by heavy rains and \"life-threatening flash floods across the Leeward Islands, including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands.\"\n\nAs of 5 p.m. ET, Maria was centered about 35 miles east-southeast of Dominica and 55 miles northeast of Martinque, the National Hurricane Center said. The mammoth storm was moving west-northwest at 9 mph.\n\nAnd for the first time in 85 years, Puerto Rico is expected to suffer a direct landfall from a Category 4 hurricane. Puerto Rico's governor has declared a state of emergency ahead of that landfall, which will likely happen Wednesday.\n\n\"It's time to wrap up your preparations now, Puerto Rico,\" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\n\nBracing for impact\n\nDominica is a small island with a population of nearly 74,000 about halfway between Puerto Rico and Trinidad and Tobago, according to the CIA World Factbook. It's nearly 290 square miles (751 square kilometers) and \"slightly more than four times the size of Washington DC.\"\n\n\"The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture -- primarily bananas -- in years past, but increasingly has been driven by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an 'ecotourism' destination,\" the factbook said.\n\nHours before Maria's expected landfall on Dominica -- and just over week after the island was brushed by Irma -- Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit urged residents to take any belongings that could become dangerous projectiles indoors.\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Irma tears through Caribbean Workers remove debris on Thursday, September 14, in Friars Bay on the French Caribbean island of Saint Martin.

Therefore, the goal must not be on stockpiling supplies but on mitigating damage caused by flying objects.\"\n\nIn Antigua, another island battered by Irma, yacht skipper Kevin Joseph took extra precautions ahead of Maria.\n\n\"Our company, we have lost in excess of a hundred boats so far by Hurricane Irma, and for that reason we're not taking any chances,\" Joseph said.\n\n\"We're gonna take the remainder of the fleet that's here in Antigua, and we're gonna take them south to the island of Martinique where they're safe for shelter so that we can ride out the impending storm.\"\n\nScrambling in Puerto Rico\n\nPuerto Rico sheltered many of the evacuees who fled Hurricane Irma's wrath in other Caribbean islands. Now those evacuees and native Puerto Ricans are bracing for another catastrophic hurricane.\n\n#Maria's winds will become dangerous Tuesday in Puerto Rico & US Virgin Islands.Preparation should now be underway to protect lives/property pic.twitter.com/fSjqOCnYij — NWS (@NWS) September 18, 2017\n\nIssa Alexander barely survived Irma when that hurricane shredded his family's home in the British Virgin Islands. He evacuated to San Juan, Puerto Rico -- only to face the prospect of more devastation.\n\n\"I'm hoping that Maria doesn't come, but I don't know,\" said Alexander, 22.\n\nHe's terrified for relatives still in the British Virgin Islands -- especially because the lines of communication are still down.\n\n\"I don't even know if they know that it (Maria) is coming,\" Alexander said. \"I can only hope that the same spirit that everybody has -- the same God that helped everybody to survive is still looking over them.\"\n\nPuerto Rico housing authorities said there are 450 shelters able to take in 62,714 evacuees, and up to 125,428 in an emergency situation. But there are six fewer shelters available post-Irma, since some schools still have no electricity.\n\nWhat to expect from Maria\n\nOther Leeward Islands are now under hurricane warnings, including Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat. The US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Martinique also under warnings.\n\n\"Maria will affect portions of the Leeward Islands and the British and US Virgin Islands as an extremely dangerous major hurricane during the next couple of days, and hurricane warnings are in effect for many of these islands,\" the center said.\n\nThere are tropical storm warnings in effect for Antigua and Barbuda, Saba and St. Eustatius, St. Martin, Anguilla and St. Lucia. The government of the Dominican Republic has issued a hurricane watch from Isla Saona to Puerto Plata, and a tropical storm watch west of Puerto Plata to the northern Dominican Republic-Haiti border.\n\nThe British Foreign Office said more than 1,300 troops are in the region, on affected islands or nearby locations, ready to help after Maria goes by. One military team has been deployed to the British Virgin Islands.\n\nA British military reconaissance team is on standby to go to Montserrat and assess needs, the office said. The HMS Ocean is set to arrive in the area at week's end with 60 tons of government supplies.\n\nUp to 12 inches of rain -- and even 20 inches in some areas -- are expected to deluge the central and southern Leeward Islands through Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are expected across Puerto Rico,\" the NHC said. \"Rainfall on all of these islands could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,\" it said.\n\n'More dangerous than Hugo and Georges'\n\nPuerto Rico's governor ordered evacuations Monday ahead of Tuesday's deteriorating conditions. Roselló said that Maria will be \"catastrophic\" and \"damaging to the infrastructure.\" The governor said that the only focus right now is to ensure the government can \"save lives.\"\n\n\"Our call is for people to evacuate areas that are prone to floods and landslides, in addition to vulnerable structures,\" Rosselló said.\n\n\"It is time to seek refuge with a family member, friend, or move to a state shelter because rescuers will not go out and risk their lives once winds reach 50 miles per hour.\"\n\nRosselló added that Maria's size means all of Puerto Rico will experience hurricane conditions.\n\nIf Maria strikes the island as forecast, it will be \"more dangerous than Hugo and Georges,\" he said.\n\nHurricane Jose\n\nAnother hurricane, Jose, is also churning in the Atlantic and has spawned tropical storm warnings for part of the US East Coast.\n\nWhile forecasters don't anticipate Jose making landfall in the US, it's still expected to cause \"dangerous surf and rip currents\" along the East Coast in the next few days, the hurricane center said.\n\nAt 5 p.m. Monday, Hurricane Jose was about 250 miles east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and was moving north at 10 mph.\n\nThe tropical storm warning is in effect for parts of southern New England, from Watch Hill, Rhode Island, to Hull, Massachusetts, the NHC said.\n\n\"Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3 to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut, southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, through Wednesday,\" the hurricane center said.\n\n\"Minor to moderate coastal flooding is possible from Delaware to southern New England,\" the center said. \"Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas, and much of the US east coast.\"\n\nJose is expected to weaken in the next few days, but will likely remain a hurricane through Tuesday.</p>",

The last Category 4 hurricane landfall in Puerto Rico occurred in 1932, and the strongest storm to ever hit the island was San Felipe in 1928 with winds of 160 mph.\n\nFollow along below for live updates on the storm. All times are Eastern unless otherwise noted.\n\n11:01 a.m.: Maria a major hurricane over Puerto Rico\n\nHurricane Maria remained a Category 4 storm late Wednesday morning as it moved over Puerto Rico, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAs of 11 a.m., Maria had maximum sustained winds near 140 mph and its eye was located about 15 miles east-southeast of Arecibo and about 25 miles west of San Juan, the capital.\n\nThe hurricane was moving northwest at around 12 mph.\n\nNational Hurricane Center\n\n10:50 a.m.: Maria's gusts turn streets into wind tunnels\n\nStreets in the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan are like wind tunnels as Hurricane Maria barrels across the U.S. island, CBS News correspondent David Begnaud reports.\n\nWhile reporting on CBSN, Begnaud said the storm was ripping off pieces of buildings and sending them through the air like projectiles.\n\nThe CBS News crew in San Juan recorded gusts of up to 120 mph with a wind speed gauge.\n\nAt the Marriott hotel, guests were ordered to the lobby for their safety and then into an emergency stairwell after pieces of the ceiling fell down.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Trump on hurricanes: \"It's just one after another\"\n\nPresident Trump said \"it's just one after another\" this hurricane season.\n\nWhile meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah in New York Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump spoke about Hurricane Maria as it was moving across Puerto Rico.\n\n\"We have a big one going right now,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I've never seen winds like this, and Puerto Rico, you take a look at what's happening there, and it's just one after another, but I think we are doing a good job.\"\n\nThe king expressed his country's condolences to the president for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Louisiana and Texas, and Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida and the Caribbean. He also praised the U.S. response to the devastating storms.\n\n\"For us sitting on the outside looking at how the Americans came together in a difficult time, it's really an example to everybody else, and we're very, very grateful for that,\" the king said.\n\nThe king and Mr. Trump are in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly.\n\n9:23 a.m.: Maria moving across Puerto Rico\n\nThe eye of Hurricane Maria was expected to move across Puerto Rico throughout Wednesday morning, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe center said the Category 4 storm's eye would leave the island via its northern coast Wednesday afternoon. It was then expected to pass north of the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic Wednesday night or early Thursday.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, Maria had maximum sustained winds near 150 mph and was moving northwest near 10 mph. Its eye was about 15 miles south-southwest of Puerto Rico's capital of San Juan.\n\nNational Hurricane Center\n\n8:49 a.m.: Maria's death toll rises in Caribbean\n\nAn adviser to Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit says there have been seven confirmed deaths in the Caribbean country from Hurricane Maria.\n\nHartley Henry didn't give details about how the deaths occurred. They raise the overall death toll to nine from the storm, including two on the French island of Guadeloupe.\n\nHenry says the country is \"in a daze\" with no electricity or power and little to no communications.\n\nHe said in a statement Wednesday that there has been a \"tremendous loss of housing and public buildings\" in the mountainous island but the full extent of the damage isn't known. The storm struck the country Monday and Tuesday and is now over Puerto Rico.\n\n5:15 a.m.: New hurricane warnings posted\n\nThe government of the Bahamas has issued a hurricane warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Southeastern Bahamas.\n\n4:45 a.m.: Death toll ticks up\n\nThe prefect of the French island of Guadeloupe has raised the death toll stemming from Hurricane Maria from one to two people. Eric Maire said Tuesday night that in addition to one person who \"did not comply with the confinement instructions\" and was killed by a falling tree, another person died after falling \"in the sea.\"\n\nThe Guadeloupe prefecture has also said two people are reported missing after a shipwreck near the French island of Desirade.\n\nFrance's interior minister Gerard Collomb said there were three people wounded in Martinique, one seriously.\n\nThe extent of the damage from Tuesday's hurricane is yet to be assessed on those French territories.\n\n2:15 a.m.: Maria aiming at Puerto Rico\n\nHurricane Maria barreled toward Puerto Rico early Wednesday, and the National Hurricane Center warned the Category 5 storm could still be that strong when it unleashed its full fury there.\n\n1:17 a.m.: Maria's outer eyewall lashes St. Croix\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Maria's outer eyewall -- the powerful ring that surrounds the core of the hurricane -- was lashing St. Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, early Wednesday morning.\n\nA sustained wind of 90 mph with a wind gust of 127 mph was reported in the western region of St. Croix, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nTuesday, Sept. 19\n\n10:50 p.m.: President Trump tweets about Puerto Rico\n\nPresident Trump tweeted \"our hearts are with\" Puerto Rico, and wrote the island is about to be hit by a \"new monster\" hurricane.\n\nPuerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane. Be careful, our hearts are with you- will be there to help! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017\n\nIn the past few weeks, Mr. Trump has visited several U.S. states hard-hit by hurricanes. Mr. Trump traveled to Texas and Louisiana twice in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Then last week, he traveled to Fort Meyers and Naples, Florida, two of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Irma.\n\n\"I just want to tell you, we are there for you 100 percent. I'll be back here numerous times. I mean, this is a state that I know very well, as you understand. And these are special, special people, and we love 'em,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during his visit to Florida.\n\nIrma did not directly hit Puerto Rico, but still battered the island with rain and wind and left 70 percent of the island without power.\n\nClick here for Tuesday's updates on Maria.</p>",

The 345-yard dam holds back a man-made lake covering about 2 square miles and was built decades ago, U.S. government records show.\n\n\"Move to higher ground now,\" the weather service said in a statement. \"This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\"\n\n\"Act quickly to protect your life,\" it added. \"Buses will be evacuating people from these areas.\"\n\nThe government called the situation \"extremely dangerous.\" Communications to outlying areas of the island have been hampered by the storm.\n\n\"It's a structural failure.

Ricardo Rossello said from the capital, San Juan. \"We're trying to evacuate as many people as possible.\"\n\nAll across the battered island, residents feared power could be out for weeks -- or even months -- and wondered how they would cope. Some of the island's 3.4 million residents planned to head to the U.S. to temporarily escape the desolation. At least in the short term, though, the soggy misery will continue: additional rain -- up to 6 inches -- is expected through Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. territory's governor said its death toll has risen to 13.

The core of the storm was about 115 miles east-northeast of the southeastern Bahamas at 5 p.m. Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas join the central Bahamas in now being under a tropical storm warning, rather than a hurricane warning.\n\nMaria is moving to the north-northwest at 9 mph and the storm is expected to slowly weaken while making a turn toward the north by late Saturday.\n\n4:50 p.m.: Tax relief proposed for hurricane victims\n\nThe head of the House's tax-writing committee is putting forward legislation to give temporary tax relief to victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\n\nThe bill from Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, would ease requirements for deducting individual property losses and allow people to draw on their retirement funds without penalty. The legislation also seeks to encourage people around the U.S. to donate to hurricane relief efforts by temporarily suspending limits on deductions for charitable contributions.\n\nBrady says he plans to formally introduce the bill Monday. He says it \"helps hurricane victims keep more of their paycheck, deduct more of the cost of their expensive property damage, and have more affordable and immediate access to money they have saved for their retirement.\"\n\n3:40 p.m.: Congress urged to witness Puerto Rico damage\n\nDemocratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois is asking for a bipartisan delegation of congressional leaders to visit Puerto Rico so they can personally witness the damage caused by Hurricane Maria and better understand the island's needs.\n\nGutierrez is making his request in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nGutierrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, says what little Puerto Rico had in the way of public health and power infrastructure \"was literally blown away\" by the Category 4 hurricane.\n\nHe says that to understand the scope of the damage and the magnitude of the recovery, members of Congress need to see it firsthand.\n\nGutierrez says years of recession, an on-going financial crisis, and high levels of outmigration present unique challenges for the island and its government.\n\n2:50 p.m.: Puerto Rican towns evacuated as dam fails\n\nThe National Weather Service says the Guajataca Dam is failing in western Puerto Rico and buses are evacuating people \"as quickly as they can.\"\n\nThe government called the situation \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nThe weather service office in San Juan says dam operators reported at 2:10 p.m. that the dam at the northern end of Lake Guajataca in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico was failing and causing flash flooding downstream.\n\nThe northwestern municipalities of Isabela and Quebradillas, home to about 70,000 people, were being evacuated, the weather service said.\n\n2:15 p.m.: Maria moves away from Turks and Caicos Islands\n\nHurricane Maria is moving away from the Turks and Caicos Islands as a powerful Category 3 storm.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center says Maria still has maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. The core of the storm was about 90 miles north of Grand Turk Island at 2 p.m. Friday afternoon.\n\nMaria is moving to the north-northwest at 9 mph and the storm is expected to slowly weaken while making a turn toward the north by late Saturday. Forecasters in the Miami center say Maria's fierce core is expected to move away from the Turks and Caicos Islands in coming hours and move to the northeast and east of the Bahamas over the weekend.\n\nNational Hurricane Center\n\n1:45 p.m.: Some residents will stay, others will leave Puerto Rico\n\n\n\nWhile some residents plan to leave Puerto Rico because of power outages and other hardships, others said they will stay put following Maria.\n\nIsrael Molina, 68, owner of Israel Mini Market in San Juan, said he has owned the shop for 26 years. He bought it and rebuilt it after Hurricane Hugo hit. \"This is catastrophic,\" he said, as he surveyed pieces of roofing that had been ripped away. But Molina has no plans to leave -- for now.\n\n\"I'm from here. I believe we have to step up to the task. If everyone leaves, what are we going to do? With all the pros and the cons, I will stay here,\" he said, and then paused. \"I might have a different response tomorrow.\"\n\nNot far away, Diana Jaquez assessed damage from the storm with help from her husband as their children played. She is one of the owners of the Coquette hair salon. \"I haven't decided yet,\" she said when asked if she planned to leave Puerto Rico.\n\n1:10 p.m.: At least 110 homes destroyed in Dominican Republic\n\nEmergency responders are reporting at least 110 homes have been destroyed by floodwaters in different communities around the Dominican Republic.\n\nJuan Manuel Mendez, an emergency operations chief, says at least 18,500 evacuees are being kept from their homes while waiting for floodwaters to subside.\n\nAuthorities say rivers overflowed and debris carried along by the floodwaters destroyed four bridges and have cut off 78 small communities on the island.\n\n\"The river caught us by surprise,\" said Maria Acosta, a mother of three who used a bucket to try to remove mud that washed into her home in El Seibo, in the eastern part of the nation.\n\n1:05 p.m.: New York governor flies to Puerto Rico\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is heading to the Caribbean for the second time in a week to get a firsthand look at hurricane damage.\n\nThe Democrat departed from JFK Airport on Friday morning for Puerto Rico. Cuomo's office says Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello asked his New York counterpart for assistance to help the recovery.\n\nCuomo is traveling on a donated JetBlue aircraft that officials said was the first flight to depart for San Juan since the storm. Last week Cuomo traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricane Irma.\n\nNew York plans to send about 240 National Guardsmen and state troopers to assist Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The state is also sending drinking water, ready-to-eat meals, electrical generators and other supplies for the island territory ravaged by Hurricane Maria.\n\n12:50 p.m.: National Guard helps U.S. Virgin Islands with recovery\n\nAn Air National Guard unit from Maine is deploying to the U.S. Virgin Islands to provide critical communications to support the recovery efforts.\n\nSeven Air National Guard members from the 265th Combat Communications Squadron mobilized late Thursday.The 265th is tasked with establishing communications links for military, and if necessary, for civilian response authorities. The U.S. Virgin Islands are reeling after back-to-back hurricanes.\n\n12:40 p.m.: Dominican Republic president tours devastated areas\n\nThe president of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, is touring areas hit hard by Maria.\n\nAuthorities say several rivers burst their banks in the island nation, destroying several bridges and inflicting major damage on several highways. Emergency crews are now clearing storm debris on a key highway to the eastern tip of the island and its beach resorts of Bavaro-Punta Cana. Meanwhile, some 300,000 homes are without power after Maria's winds toppled many utility poles.\n\nAlso Friday, Puerto Rico was digging out from the storm. Some generators in Puerto Rico have been breaking down or running out of gas, prompting at least two hotels to evacuate hundreds of people. Families also were awaiting news about when the island's airport would reopen, with many planning to fly their children to the U.S. to temporarily enroll them in schools there until life in Puerto Rico returns to normal.\n\n12:10 p.m.: Puerto Rico residents face hardships\n\n\"This is an absolute crisis,\" said Alana Yendez, a 44-year-old maintenance worker as she sat on the steps of her devastated home and rocked her 2-month-old grandson, Armani James. \"There's so much flooding. My roof completely collapsed.\"\n\nShe and 11 other relatives sought shelter in a next-door building that a family had abandoned. They had six barrels of water they estimated would last them one month.\n\nNearby, 64-year-old retiree Neida Febus left her home carrying bowls of rice and ground meat topped with avocado. She had cooked for her neighbors who shared some of their food earlier as they waited for officials to say when the power might return.\n\n\"It won't be until Christmas,\" she said. \"This storm crushed us from one end of the island to the other.\"\n\n1:49 p.m.: Mayor: \"Total annihilation\" in Puerto Rico\n\nCBS News correspondent David Begnaud spoke with Mayor Carmen Yulín of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Friday about how the U.S. territory is recovering from hurricane damage.\n\n\"We know it's terrible, it's total annihilation, devastation,\" Yulín said. \"(There's) no power anywhere in Puerto Rico, no drinking water. What we're concerned about is the people we may not be able to get to, the elderly, the people that are in wheelchairs, the people that have respirators that are in need.\"\n\nAccording to Yulín, workers are canvassing each street for victims, which is very difficult.\n\n\"The entire island is devastated,\" she said. \"There's about 20 municipalities that are totally severed. No communication, no one can come in, no one can go out.\"\n\nMaria caused at least 13 deaths on Puerto Rico.\n\n\"The human spirit is something of a wonder,\" Yulín said. \"We are a resilient bunch of people. And if Maria thinks she's gonna make us kneel, she's got something coming her way that is more powerful, more brilliant and more devastating, which is the power of the human spirit.\"\n\n11:38 a.m.: Maria passing Turks and Caicos Islands\n\nHurricane Maria is churning northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands with top sustained winds of 125 mph.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says the core of the major Category 3 hurricane is about 55 miles north of Grand Turk Island. It's moving to the northwest at 8 mph.\n\nA hurricane warning continues to be in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands as well as the southeastern Bahamas. The storm is expected to turn toward the north and northwest later Friday and head northeast and east of the Bahamas through Sunday. Maria is also expected to begin to gradually weaken over the next 48 hours.\n\n6:58 a.m.: Maria's eye near Turks and Caicos Islands\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center says the eye of Hurricane Maria is near the Turks and Caicos Islands while rains and dangerous high waves are starting to subside along the northern coast of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs of 5 a.m. EDT, the storm was centered about 35 miles east-northeast of Grand Turk Island and is moving northwest at 7 mph.\n\nThe Category 3 hurricane has maximum sustained winds near 125 mph but gradual weakening is expected during the next two days.\n\nThe hurricane has ravaged Puerto Rico and people there face the prospect of going weeks and perhaps months without electricity.\n\nNational Hurricane Center\n\n4:45 a.m.: Hurricane conditions expected all day in Turks and Caicos\n\nThe eye of Hurricane Maria was heading for the Turks and Caicos Islands early Friday morning at about 7 mph, but was expected to spare that island chain and the Bahamas a direct hit.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said in its 2 a.m. update that \"Maria's eye will gradually move near or just east of\" the islands. But with sustained winds of 125 mph and gusts even higher, the Category 3 storm still presented a significant danger.\n\nThe 2 a.m. advisory said hurricane conditions were expected to continue all Friday spreading in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas, and tropical storm conditions were possible in the central Bahamas from later in the day.\n\nThe storm's location at 2 a.m. was about 100 miles north of the Dominican Republic, and 45 miles east southeast of Grand Turk Island.\n\n12:39 a.m. Sept. 22: Maria taking its time approaching Turks and Caicos\n\nHurricane Maria, still a Category 3 storm, is taking its time approaching the Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nDangerous high winds and torrential rains continued along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic as the storm slowly moves closer to Turks and Caicos.\n\nMaria's eye is expected to gradually move away from the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and then move near or just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Friday.\n\nPuerto Rico is still being lashed by rain, and flash flooding warnings continue.\n\n10 p.m. Sept. 21: Trump speaks with Puerto Rico governor\n\nThe White House says President Trump spoke with the governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nMr. Trump said earlier Thursday that Puerto Rico was \"absolutely obliterated\" and the Virgin Islands were \"flattened\" by recent hurricanes Irma and Maria.\n\nThe entire island of Puerto Rico was left without power after Maria knocked out its already weakened electrical grid.\n\nMr. Trump said FEMA and other emergency responders are helping both U.S. territories begin the recovery process.\n\nHe says he'll visit Puerto Rico.\n\nClick here for Thursday's updates on the storm.</p>",

The mountain town of Juncos is one of the most affected areas in Puerto Rico, and it remains largely isolated from the rest of the island — and the world. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn the heat and humidity here in the central mountains, Meryanne Aldea fanned her bedridden mother with a piece of cardboard Sunday as the ailing woman lay on her side, relieving a large ulcer in her back.\n\nThe 63-year-old mother, Maria Dolores Hernandez, had cotton stuffed in her ears to keep flies out, since her now screenless windows were letting all sorts of bugs in. The gray-haired diabetic woman spoke with her daughter about her worries: that she would run out of prescription drugs, that they were almost out of generator fuel to keep her insulin refrigerated and to run the fans at night. With all the heat, she feared that her ulcer would become infected.\n\nBut she worried most about her daughter’s home on the floor above hers, which was destroyed by Hurricane Maria. The shrieking winds had ripped off the zinc roof and the pounding rains had soaked the unprotected rooms below. While the outer concrete walls were mostly intact, everything else was ruined, covered by dirty tree branches, leaves, glass and debris.\n\nAldea reached out to hold her mother’s hand.\n\n“Relax,” she said. “It’s okay.”\n\n[‘If anyone can hear us … help.’ Puerto Rico’s mayors describe widespread devastation from Hurricane Maria]\n\nFour days after a major hurricane battered Puerto Rico, leaving the entire island in a communications and power blackout, regions outside San Juan remained disconnected from the rest of the island — and the world. Juncos, in a mountainous region southeast of the capital that was slammed with Maria’s most powerful winds, remains isolated, alone, afraid.\n\n\n\nThe Aldea home, which was hit by Hurricane Maria. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/For The Washington Post)\n\nFor many residents, the challenge of accessing the essentials of modern life — gasoline, cash, food, water — began to sink in. And government officials had no answers for them. Estimates for the return of electricity and basic services will be measured not in days but in weeks and months. For those most vulnerable, far too long.\n\nMany have been openly wondering when help will arrive, whether from local officials or from the federal government. The first thing some villagers ask when they see outsiders: “Are you FEMA?”\n\nFor federal agencies trying to respond to Maria, the situation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is inescapably more challenging than the situations in Texas and Florida after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. It’s difficult to get onto the islands.\n\nThe airports and harbors here were severely damaged. That means the islands are more isolated than ever, even as the humanitarian crisis has worsened by the day.\n\nSo although massive amounts of food, water, fuel and other supplies have been dispatched by federal agencies and private organizations, with more resources on the way, this has been an obstacle-filled process.\n\nFederal agencies have succeeded in clearing the use of the Port of San Juan for daytime operations, but other ports remain closed pending inspections. Many roads are blocked, inhibiting relief convoys. The Transportation Department has opened five airports in Puerto Rico and two in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but only for military and relief efforts.\n\nSix commercial cargo ships have delivered supplies including food, water and generators to the Caribbean islands, and more supplies are on the way by ship from Florida and by air from Florida and Kentucky. Among the provisions: The Defense Logistics Agency is sending 124,000 gallons of diesel fuel to Puerto Rico.\n\nMayor Carmen Yulín Cruz recounts the many struggles Puerto Rico's capital city is facing as it tries to regain its footing after Hurricane Maria. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nIn addition to concerns about basic survival, on the west side of the island worries have intensified about a ruptured dam that has been tenuously holding back the waters of Lake Guajataca. Government officials said Sunday that the “fissure” in the dam is “large and will collapse at any time.” Throngs of residents in nearby towns have been urged to evacuate. The dam’s failure could lead to massive amounts of water flowing unabated through coastal communities.\n\nIn Juncos, scores of homes were destroyed, and thousands of homes sustained damage, Mayor Alfredo Alejandro estimated. Four highways are inaccessible by car, and two bridges were harmed. Roofs of homes all over town are gone, and almost all government buildings were damaged.\n\nMountains typically brimming with trees and other vegetation are brown and desolate, stripped of all greenery. The mayor of 17 years said he discovered a river he never knew existed in his town, because it was always overgrown with plants. Curved bamboo lining the winding roads were left as bare sticks.\n\nLess than a week ago, Alejandro said, “I had a pretty town.”\n\n“Today I have a desert,” he said.\n\nPuerto Rico’s executive director of emergency management said in an interview that aerial views of destruction in this region looked “more like a tornado than a hurricane.”\n\nBut Maria’s destruction in the town was just the beginning. The mayor said Juncos “anxiously” needs diesel, water, hospital equipment and satellite phones for local leadership. Some local responders were forced to clear streets by hand with machetes, because the town doesn’t have enough chain saws.\n\n\n\nA man walks from Juncos to a nearby town in search of gasoline. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/For The Washington Post)\n\nJust two gas stations were functioning in the town, and lines stretched for more than half a mile. Some drivers camped out in their cars at one station on Saturday night, but awoke Sunday to find out the gasoline there had run out, one resident said. Some people walked and rode bicycles for miles with empty gas canisters in hand.\n\nOne of the town’s two supermarkets was open Sunday, and employees would let in only 10 people at a time to avoid chaos. Residents, who stood in line for hours, could purchase only rationed food. There is no functioning bank or cash machine in the entire municipality.\n\nWhen Aldea, 37, and her 5-year-old daughter walked through her shell of a home in Juncos after the hurricane had passed, the child hardly said a word. She scoured her pink room, with pony stickers on its walls, and picked out a couple of soaked dolls and coloring books.\n\n“We don’t have a house anymore,” Aldea explained to her daughter, Darangellie. “We’re going to have to start new with what we have.”\n\n\n\nA destroyed group of houses in Juncos. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/For The Washington Post)\n\nAldea, who works as a secretary in the mayor’s office, is living with and taking care of her mother in the tiny room downstairs. Darangellie spends most of the days with a relative in town, but at night she sleeps with her mother. The child has asthma and needs to use a daily nebulizer treatment — requiring her mother to turn on their generator at night. They have enough diesel to power the generator for one more day.\n\nShe has a half-tank of gas left and can’t set aside the entire day that would be necessary to wait in line for more because she has to care for her daughter and mother. It doesn’t help that driving to town for her job — which usually takes seven minutes — now takes more than a half-hour because of blocked or inaccessible roads.\n\nBut Aldea remained calm. More than anything, she is thankful to be alive: “If I don’t stay strong, how can I take care of the two people who depend on me?”\n\n\n\nThe house of Maribel Quiñones Rivera and her family was left in ruins. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/For The Washington Post)\n\nAcross town, a second-level three-bedroom apartment was ripped to shreds, the cooking appliances, kitchen counters and cabinets the only surviving evidence of the wooden structure.\n\nMaribel Quiñones Rivera, 53, lived with her husband in the home for decades, raising her children and grandchildren there. During the hurricane and in the days that followed, she sought shelter with relatives in their apartment directly below.\n\nOn Sunday, she still hadn’t walked upstairs to see the debris up close. When asked why, she shook her head and cried. “I can’t,” she said.\n\nTo make matters worse, Quiñones Rivera and her relatives are out of cash — they used their last $30 to buy gasoline. They have five or six bottles of water left.\n\nThere are some moments of hope amid the misery in Juncos. On Sunday, about 30 people gathered in a small blue church for Mass. The priest apologized for the lack of a microphone and said the service would be brief.\n\nAida Sanchez, a member of the congregation, said she came to thank God.\n\n“Because despite the circumstances,” she said, “we’re alive.”\n\n\n\nSunday Mass at San Juan Bautista Church in Juncos.

Among the provisions: The Defense Logistics Agency is sending 124,000 gallons of diesel fuel to Puerto Rico.\n\nMayor Carmen Yulín Cruz recounts the many struggles Puerto Rico's capital city is facing as it tries to regain its footing after Hurricane Maria. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nIn addition to concerns about basic survival, on the west side of the island worries have intensified about a ruptured dam that has been tenuously holding back the waters of Lake Guajataca. Government officials said Sunday that the “fissure” in the dam is “large and will collapse at any time.” Throngs of residents in nearby towns have been urged to evacuate. The dam’s failure could lead to massive amounts of water flowing unabated through coastal communities.\n\nIn Juncos, scores of homes were destroyed, and thousands of homes sustained damage, Mayor Alfredo Alejandro estimated. Four highways are inaccessible by car, and two bridges were harmed. Roofs of homes all over town are gone, and almost all government buildings were damaged.\n\nMountains typically brimming with trees and other vegetation are brown and desolate, stripped of all greenery. The mayor of 17 years said he discovered a river he never knew existed in his town, because it was always overgrown with plants. Curved bamboo lining the winding roads were left as bare sticks.\n\nLess than a week ago, Alejandro said, “I had a pretty town.”\n\n“Today I have a desert,” he said.\n\nPuerto Rico’s executive director of emergency management said in an interview that aerial views of destruction in this region looked “more like a tornado than a hurricane.”\n\nBut Maria’s destruction in the town was just the beginning. The mayor said Juncos “anxiously” needs diesel, water, hospital equipment and satellite phones for local leadership.\n\nSome local responders in Juncos were forced to clear area streets by hand with machetes, because the town doesn’t have enough chain saws.\n\n\n\nA man walks from Juncos to a nearby town in search of gasoline. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/For The Washington Post)\n\nJust two gas stations were functioning in the town, and lines stretched for more than half a mile. Some people walked and rode bicycles for miles with empty gas canisters in hand.\n\nOne of the town’s two supermarkets was open Sunday, and employees would let in only 10 people at a time to avoid chaos. Residents, who stood in line for hours, could purchase only rationed food. There is no functioning bank or cash machine in the entire municipality.\n\nWhen Aldea, 37, and her 5-year-old daughter walked through her shell of a home in Juncos after the hurricane had passed, the child hardly said a word. She scoured her pink room, with pony stickers on its walls, and picked out a couple of soaked dolls and coloring books.\n\n“We don’t have a house anymore,” Aldea explained to her daughter, Darangellie. “We’re going to have to start new with what we have.”\nAldea, who works as a secretary in the mayor’s office, is living with and taking care of her mother in the tiny room downstairs. Darangellie spends most of the days with a relative in town, but at night she sleeps with her mother. The child has asthma and needs to use a daily nebulizer treatment — requiring her mother to turn on their generator at night. They have enough diesel to power the generator for one more day.\n\nShe has a half-tank of gas left and can’t set aside the entire day that would be necessary to wait in line for more because she has to care for her daughter and mother. It doesn’t help that driving to town for her job — which usually takes seven minutes — now takes more than a half-hour because of blocked or inaccessible roads.\n\nBut Aldea remained calm. More than anything, she is thankful to be alive: “If I don’t stay strong, how can I take care of the two people who depend on me?”\n\n\nAcross town, a second-level three-bedroom apartment was ripped to shreds in the storm, the cooking appliances, kitchen counters and cabinets the only surviving evidence of the wooden structure.\n\nMaribel Quiñones Rivera, 53, lived with her husband in the home for decades, raising her children and grandchildren there. During the hurricane and in the days that followed, she sought shelter with relatives in their apartment directly below.\n\nOn Sunday, she still hadn’t walked upstairs to see the debris up close. When asked why, she shook her head and cried. “I can’t,” she said.\n\nTo make matters worse, Quiñones Rivera and her relatives are out of cash — they used their last $30 to buy gasoline. They have five or six bottles of water left.\n\nThere are some moments of hope amid the misery in Juncos. On Sunday, about 30 people gathered in a small blue church for Mass. The priest apologized for the lack of a microphone and said the service would be brief.\n\nAida Sanchez, a member of the congregation, said she came to thank God.\n\n“Because despite the circumstances,” she said, “we’re alive.”\n\n\nAchenbach reported from Washington.

He noted that, by contrast, Texas and Florida, hit by earlier hurricanes, “are doing great.”\n\nTexas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.. — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017\n\nMonday night’s tweets were the first from Trump about Puerto Rico since Wednesday, when the hurricane made landfall and Trump declared “we are with you.”\n\nPower remains out on much of the island, and officials say they are facing numerous logistical challenges, including damage to airports and ports. But FEMA says its response has been robust, including the deployment of 10,000 federal workers.\n\nCriticism of Trump has come from Democratic politicians, celebrities and others, focusing in part on the heavy attention he has put in recent days on his opposition to football players who kneel during the national anthem.\n\n“At the same time that he was doing all of that, we had American citizens in Puerto Rico who are in a desperate condition,” Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee Trump defeated last year, said in a radio interview on Monday. “He has not said one word about them, about other American citizens in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I’m not sure he knows that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.”\n\nMarc Anthony, the Latin pop singer, was more blunt, urging Trump on Twitter to “shut the [expletive] up about NFL.”\n\n“Do something about our people in need in #PuertoRico,” Anthony wrote. “We are American citizens too.”\n\nActor Kal Penn, who worked in the White House during President Barack Obama’s tenure, said on Twitter that was “outrageous & unsurprising that our President won’t race to help fellow Americans.”\n\nOutrageous & unsurprising that our President won't race to help fellow Americans, so we have to do our part. Here:https://t.co/6GlwORoef5 — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) September 26, 2017\n\nAnd some Republicans chimed in as well.\n\n“There are millions of our fellow Americans on Puerto Rico facing great danger and suffering,” GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, a frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter on Monday. “Trump silence and inaction is appalling.”\n\nTrump’s lack of public attention to Puerto Rico has been striking in part because of the major focus he put on helping Texas and Florida recover from earlier hurricanes, a factor many analysts have cited in explaining Trump’s recent uptick in his job approval numbers.\n\nDuring a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was peppered with questions about Trump’s priorities, including his focus on Puerto Rico.\n\nShe noted that Trump had dispatched Brock Long, the FEMA administrator, and Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security adviser, to assess the damage in Puerto Rico.\n\n“The federal response has been anything but slow,” Sanders said. “In fact, there’s been an unprecedented push through of billions of dollars in federal assistance that the administration has fought for. … And once we have a greater insight into the full assessment of damage, then we’ll be able to determine what additional funds are needed.”</p>",

                  "text": "<p>As the devastation from Hurricane Maria became more apparent Sunday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton implored President Trump and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to help the people of Puerto Rico. Send the Navy, she tweeted, especially the hospital ship USNS Comfort.\n\nPresident Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens. https://t.co/J2FVg4II0n — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 24, 2017\n\nTwo days later, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Brock Long announced that the Navy will soon do exactly that. The decision, announced in front of the White House on Tuesday afternoon, was not later confirmed by the Navy. It comes after days of critics saying that the U.S. government isn’t doing enough to support hurricane relief in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 3.4 million people that faces months without electricity and a long rebuilding process.\n\nNavy Cmdr. Mike Kafka said that the ship will leave within the next four days, and it will take five additional days to reach Puerto Rico. He called the move a “prudent decision in light of current conditions on ground.”\n\nClinton’s tweet lacked important context : The Navy already had two amphibious ships off the coast, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill, so the few thousand Marines and sailors aboard could launch relief operations. But her call to action took off , with a petition on the federal website Change.org garnering more than 100,000 signatures in three days and critics expressing frustration with the hashtag #SendtheComfort.\n\nSince then, the call for the Comfort has come to symbolize something larger: A call for the Pentagon to send more.\n\nMore food. More water. More generators. More aircraft.\n\nMore everything.\n\nPreliminary Major Hurricane Maria Estimated Rainfall across Puerto Rico & U.S. Virgin Islands. #prwx #usviwx pic.twitter.com/mcluYuSBcR — NWS San Juan (@NWSSanJuan) September 21, 2017\n\nTrump described the U.S. government response to the devastation in glowing terms Tuesday morning, saying officials were “doing a really good job.” He plans to visit next week, once it is no longer a disruption to first responders, he said.\n\n“It’s very tough because it’s an island,” Trump said. “In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there. And you know, we’ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and on Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico. But the difference is, this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. And it’s a big ocean; it’s a very big ocean.”\n\nFacing growing criticism about its response, the Pentagon on Monday argued that its efforts over the weekend marked only the beginning. Army Col. Rob Manning, a spokesman, told reporters the U.S. military was focused near-term on search-and-rescue operations and delivering generators to hospitals. Other plans called for the arrival of eight Army Black Hawk helicopters from Fort Campbell, Ky., a fleet of Air Force jets arriving with supplies, and disaster-assessment teams determining what else is needed.\n\n“This is a long-term effort,” Manning said. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint, so [the Department of Defense] will continue to support them as long as support is needed.”\n\nThe Pentagon’s effort is complemented by the U.S. Coast Guard, a part of the military overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. The sea service had 13 ships off Puerto Rico by Monday, and was working long shifts to fix ports and and launch search-and-rescue missions.\n\nBut the Navy’s presence was scrutinized. Thomas LaCrosse, the Pentagon’s director of defense support to civil authorities, said U.S. officials discussed sending the Comfort to Puerto Rico over the weekend, but ultimately decided not to because ports were not ready to handle a ship that large after the storm.\n\nThe Comfort, homeported in Norfolk, Va., is one of two hospital ships in the U.S. military, and the only one kept on the East Coast. The 894-foot vessel has about 1,000 beds for patients, 12 operating rooms and a flight deck for heavy-lift helicopters. It has been used following numerous natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the earthquake that devastated Haiti in 2010.\n\nBut LaCrosse and other defense officials had argued that the situation now is different. The Puerto Rican government did not ask for more Navy ships, but logistical support that includes getting its 60-plus hospitals up and running, LaCrosse said. In light of that, the Pentagon made the judgment call to send in a fleet of Air Force jets loaded with supplies and medical personnel beginning Friday, after the Army Corps of Engineers re-opened Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, he said.\n\nMarine Corps Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Senate lawmakers Tuesday that the military continues to respond to the crisis, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency in charge. Air Force Gen. Lori J. Robinson, the chief of U.S. Northern Command, is making suggestions and recommendations along the way, he said.\n\n“There’s literally hourly meetings between FEMA and the government officials in Puerto Rico, to make sure that we are doing all we can,” Dunford said. “The guidance from Secretary Mattis has been clear. What they need, they get. Just make it happen.”\n\nKafka, the Navy spokesman, said that the military actually was better positioned to respond to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico than it was previous storms in the Caribbean islands. The Navy and Marine Corps already were working off the Kearsarge, Oak Hill and a third ship, the USS Wasp, to help following Hurricane Irma’s devastation there earlier in the month, and moved south out of Maria’s path before quickly returning, he said.\n\nThe size of Maria and it’s unpredictable course also may have played a role in how the U.S. military responded. The Navy had several ships, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, providing hurricane relief off the Florida Keys. But commanders sent them back to port in Norfolk, Va., and Mayport, Fla., rather than leaving them off the east coast of Florida or in the Caribbean.\n\nStill, the response and the characterization of it is in contrast with how the military responded to Irma in Florida and the Caribbean islands. In that case, the U.S. government deployed at least eight ships, and Tom Bossert, President Trump’s homeland security adviser, described the effort as both “unprecedented” and “the largest flotilla operation in our nation’s history,” though more ships had been used in other similar operations in the past.\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D.-Wash.), the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said Monday night that at minimum, Trump should establish a “coordinated military effort” overseen by a three-star general, a move that occurred after Hurricane Katrina and other disasters, such as a typhoon that hit the Philippines in 2013.\n\n“The Trump administration’s response to the destruction in Puerto Rico has been wholly inadequate,” Smith said. “A territory of 3.5 million American citizens is almost completely without power, water, food, and telephone service, and we have a handful of helicopters involved in DOD’s response. It’s a disgrace.”</p>",

                  "text": "<p>After the Category 4 hurricane slammed into Puerto Rico, many of the more than 3.4 million U.S. citizens in the territory were still without adequate food, water, electricity and fuel. Flights off the island were infrequent, communications were spotty and roads were clogged with debris.\n\nAfter an earthquake shattered Haiti’s capital on Jan. 12, 2010, the U.S. military mobilized as if it were going to war.\n\nBefore dawn the next morning, an Army unit was airborne, on its way to seize control of the main airport in Port-au-Prince. Within two days, the Pentagon had 8,000 American troops en route. Within two weeks, 33 U.S. military ships and 22,000 troops had arrived. More than 300 military helicopters buzzed overhead, delivering millions of pounds of food and water.\n\nNo two disasters are alike. Each delivers customized violence that cannot be fully anticipated. But as criticism of the federal government’s initial response to the crisis in Puerto Rico continued to mount Thursday, the mission to Haiti — an island nation several hundred miles from the U.S. mainland — stands as an example of how quickly relief efforts can be mobilized.\n\nBy contrast, eight days after Hurricane Maria ripped across neighboring Puerto Rico, just 4,400 service members were participating in federal operations to assist the devastated island, an Army general told reporters Thursday. In addition, about 1,000 Coast Guard members were aiding the efforts. About 40 U.S. military helicopters were helping to deliver food and water to the 3.4 million residents of the U.S. territory, along with 10 Coast Guard helicopters.\n\nLeaders of the humanitarian mission in Haiti said in interviews that they were dismayed by the relative lack of urgency and military muscle in the initial federal response to Puerto Rico’s catastrophe.\n\n“I think it’s a fair ask why we’re not seeing a similar command and response,” said retired Lt. Gen. P.K. “Ken” Keen, the three-star general who commanded the U.S. military effort in Haiti, where 200,000 people died by some estimates. “The morning after, the president said we were going to respond in Port-au-Prince . . . robustly and immediately, and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose.”\n\nRajiv J. Shah, who led the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Haiti response, said he, too, was struggling to “understand the delays.”\n\n“We were able to move more quickly in a foreign country, and with no warning because it was an earthquake, than a better-equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory,” he said.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has defended its efforts in Puerto Rico, saying it is coordinating a wide-ranging campaign to simultaneously deliver food, water and medicine and to restore power, clear pathways to hospitals and reopen mangled ports and airports.\n\nIt’s a monumental task, one that FEMA says has been complicated immensely by a near-complete collapse of cellphone service on the island, as well as years of neglect to power lines and other utility systems.\n\nFEMA and Defense Department officials have taken steps to beef up the response, announcing Thursday that they would elevate the military command structure on the ground in Puerto Rico, sending in a three-star Army general, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Tom Bossert said on Sept. 28 the Army Corps of Engineers will have a dedicated mission to restore power in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. (Reuters)\n\nKeen, who was named to lead the efforts in Haiti three days after the quake, pointed to a complicating factor: Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, not a foreign nation, and that makes a huge difference in the rules of engagement when disaster strikes.\n\nIn Haiti, the United States was able to deploy active military combat brigades, quickly install a military commander and militarize the airspace at the invitation of Haitian officials.\n\nIn Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, the nearly 140-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the role that active military personnel can play.\n\nAlso, Puerto Rico’s aid requests, made under a mutual-assistance compact among the states and U.S. territories, helped shape the response. In recent days, as criticism of the effort has grown, administration officials have repeatedly said they are delivering what Puerto Rico has asked for.\n\nMaj. Gen. James C. Witham, director of domestic operations for the National Guard Bureau, said that immediately after Maria’s landfall, Puerto Rico requested only communications equipment and fewer than 200 military police officers. By comparison, 17,567 guardsmen from 24 states were on duty in Florida a day after Hurricane Irma made landfall.\n\nMore than 400 guardsmen from other states had been in Puerto Rico, assigned to help with cleanup from Irma, before Maria. Most evacuated in advance of Maria, and Puerto Rico has made no request for them to return, officials said.\n\nAll but about a few hundred of the 2,000 guardsmen now in Puerto Rico are members of the territory’s own Guard unit. The National Guard Bureau has drafted plans to send as many as 6,000 soldiers, but Puerto Rico has yet to request them, Witham said.\n\n“Essentially, everything Puerto Rico has asked for up to and including today we’ve tried to align with and lean as far forward as we can,” Witham said.\n\nWhat is clear is that, since Maria ravaged the island, there has been a disconnect between the level of aid requested or delivered and the needs of residents who are desperate for water, food and basic necessities of life.\n\nAt a hearing Wednesday, Sen. Margaret Wood Hassan (D-N.H.) read from an email in which a former Puerto Rico governor, Alejandro García Padilla, warned that “unless we see a dramatic increase in assistance and personnel reaching the island soon, many thousands could die.”\n\n“We need the Army and the National Guard deployed throughout the island, now, today,” Hassan said, reading from the letter. “This cannot wait another day. Despite federal agencies coordinating in San Juan, there is very limited presence of military personnel assisting people in the streets and throughout our communities.”\n\nElaine Duke, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, responded: “The president, vice president and I talked with the governor yesterday. And that was about 1 o’clock. And we — he had no unmet needs at that point.”\n\nJohn Rabin, a senior FEMA official in Puerto Rico, denied during a media teleconference Thursday that the federal government is waiting for requests from officials on the island.\n\n“We are in lockstep with those guys, but we also recognize that this is a disaster and we have our priorities,” Rabin said. “We are not in a waiting mode for anything.”\n\nAlso Thursday, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló defended his government’s response to the humanitarian crisis. He said the unprecedented destruction of the storm and logistical limitations have impeded the flow of resources to some of the island’s communities.\n\nRosselló walked into a daily briefing at the Puerto Rico convention center accompanied by a general or an admiral representing each branch of the U.S. military, displaying a united front a week after the hurricane walloped the island.\n\nThe governor emphasized that federal agencies are taking their direction from the territorial government.\n\n“Let’s make this clear — this is an operation of the government of Puerto Rico,” Rosselló said. “We set the priorities. . . . We are taking action, and there are results.”\n\nRosselló said the island’s geographical challenges — everything must be brought in by boat or air — and the widespread communication failures have complicated relief efforts.\n\nW. Craig Fugate, who was President Barack Obama’s FEMA director for all eight years of his presidency, said that in a worst-case scenario, such as a tsunami, the federal government had long contemplated that Puerto Rico could be completely isolated, with its ports destroyed and all food and water needing to be airlifted onto the island or shuttled by Marine units that could land on beaches.\n\nFugate said FEMA did not have to wait for a signal from Puerto Rican authorities before activating more military assets.\n\nTwo U.S. defense officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation, said the inability to communicate readily with Puerto Rican officials immediately after the storm delayed the response. Another limiting factor, they said, was that FEMA officials did not have a full understanding of the devastation and the challenges until Director William “Brock” Long visited the island Monday. The next day, Long announced outside the White House that the military would deploy to Puerto Rico the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort.\n\nAt least two other Navy ships, the USS Iwo Jima and the USS New York, responded to Hurricane Irma earlier in the month off the Florida Keys and could have been used to respond to Maria. Defense officials said they were instead sent back to Mayport, Fla., and remain in port there on ­prepare-to-deploy orders. They may yet be called upon to join the response.\n\nOn the day the quake rocked Haiti, one bit of happenstance may have sped the U.S. response. Keen happened to be on the island, at the residence of the U.S. ambassador. Keen watched dust rise across the countryside as buildings collapsed. A member of his staff was killed when the hotel where they were staying crumbled.\n\nKeen relayed his firsthand account back to the head of the U.S. Southern Command, who was traveling in Washington. That night, Obama called USAID’s Shah and told him to spare no expense in responding. “He said it was a chance for America to demonstrate our moral character,” Shah recalled.\n\nAir Force combat control teams were in the air the next morning. The airport, which became “the island’s lifeline,” Keen said, was secure and operational by nightfall. Troops began arriving every couple of hours.\n\nKeen began organizing officers to conduct assessments and distribute food. Three days after the quake, his unofficial role became official — he was named Joint Task Force commander, with USAID taking the lead in coordinating the broader government response. Time magazine would later call Keen the de facto “king of Haiti.”\n\nKeen said for the seemingly slow start, the U.S. government can still correct course.\n\n“The real test of leadership,” he said, “is now what do we do about it now that it’s clear that Puerto Rico is going to need help for a long time.”\n\nArelis R.

The crisis in Puerto Rico figures to define President Trump's responses to this remarkable string of powerful storms. After first seeming to blame Puerto Rico's poor infrastructure and fiscal crises, Trump is now praising FEMA and expressing his wish that the \"press would treat fairly.\" But this is one where claims of \"fake news\" will likely be subsumed by the images and realities. Those realities include millions of American citizens in total crisis. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is warning that the lack of \"clear command, control and communication\" will cause the situation to \"deteriorate rapidly.\" The general who oversaw the federal response to Hurricane Katrina is calling the situation – yes – \"like Katrina.\" This is a heckuva comment, from acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke: \"I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths.\" Maybe she will be proven right, and Trump will be praised for taking charge. But this will require a lightly staffed administration – led by a president prone to distraction – to do a whole lot of difficult work, and fast.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>After the Category 4 hurricane slammed into Puerto Rico, many of the more than 3.4 million U.S. citizens in the territory were still without adequate food, water and fuel. Flights off the island were infrequent, communications were spotty and roads were clogged with debris.\n\nAt first, the Trump administration seemed to be doing all the right things to respond to the disaster in Puerto Rico.\n\nAs Hurricane Maria made landfall on Wednesday, Sept. 20, there was a frenzy of activity publicly and privately. The next day, President Trump called local officials on the island, issued an emergency declaration and pledged that all federal resources would be directed to help.\n\nBut then for four days after that — as storm-ravaged Puerto Rico struggled for food and water amid the darkness of power outages — Trump and his top aides effectively went dark themselves.\n\nTrump jetted to New Jersey that Thursday night to spend a long weekend at his private golf club there, save for a quick trip to Alabama for a political rally. Neither Trump nor any of his senior White House aides said a word publicly about the unfolding crisis.\n\nTrump did hold a meeting at his golf club that Friday with half a dozen Cabinet officials — including acting Homeland Security secretary Elaine Duke, who oversees disaster response — but the gathering was to discuss his new travel ban, not the hurricane. Duke and Trump spoke briefly about Puerto Rico but did not talk again until Tuesday, an administration official said.\n\nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz desperate plea for aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria's aftermath on Sept. 29. (Municipio Autónomo de San Juan)\n\nAdministration officials would not say whether the president spoke with any other top officials involved in the storm response while in Bedminster, N.J. He spent much of his time over those four days fixated on his escalating public feuds with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with fellow Republicans in Congress and with the National Football League over protests during the national anthem.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, meanwhile, the scope of the devastation was becoming clearer. Virtually the entire island was without power and much of it could be for weeks, officials estimated, and about half of the more than 3 million residents did not have access to clean water. Gas was in short supply, airports and ports were in disrepair, and telecommunications infrastructure had been destroyed.\n\nFederal and local officials said the lack of communications on the island made the task of assessing the widespread damage far more challenging, and even local officials were slow to recognize that for this storm, far more help would be necessary.\n\n“I don’t think that anybody realized how bad this was going to be,” said a person familiar with discussions between Washington and officials in Puerto Rico. “Quite frankly, the level of communications and collaboration that I’ve seen with Irma and now Maria between the administration, local government and our office has been unprecedented.”\n\n“Whether that’s been translated into effectiveness on the ground, that’s up for interpretation,” the person added.\n\nUnlike what they faced after recent storms in Texas and Florida, the federal agencies found themselves partnered with a government completely flattened by the hurricane and operating with almost no information about the status of its citizens. The Federal Emergency Management Agency struggled to find truck drivers to deliver aid from ports to people in need, for example.\n\nPresident Trump signed a waiver on Sept. 28 that lifts shipping restrictions to hurricane-battered Puerto Rico. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\n“The level of devastation and the impact on the first responders we closely work with was so great that those people were having to take care of their families and homes to an extent we don’t normally see,” said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want his statement to be interpreted as criticism of authorities in Puerto Rico. “The Department of Defense, FEMA and the federal government are having to step in to fulfill state and municipal functions that we normally just support.”\n\nEven though local officials had said publicly as early as Sept. 20, the day of the storm, that the island was “destroyed,” the sense of urgency didn’t begin to penetrate the White House until Monday, when images of the utter destruction and desperation — and criticism of the administration’s response — began to appear on television, one senior administration official said.\n\n“The Trump administration was slow off the mark,” said Rep. Darren Soto (D), the first Florida lawmaker of Puerto Rican descent elected to Congress. “. . . We’ve invaded small countries faster than we’ve been helping American citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.”\n\nTrump’s public schedule Monday was devoid of any meetings related to the storm, but he was becoming frustrated by the coverage he was seeing on TV, the senior official said.\n\nAt a dinner Monday evening with conservative leaders at the White House, Trump opened the gathering by briefly lamenting the tragedy unfolding in Puerto Rico before launching into a lengthy diatribe against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) over his opposition to the Republicans’ failed health-care bill, according to one attendee.\n\nAfter the dinner, Trump lashed out on social media. He blamed the island’s financial woes and ailing infrastructure for the difficult recovery process. He also declared that efforts to provide food, water and medical care were “doing well.”\n\nOn the ground in Puerto Rico, nothing could be further from the truth. It had taken until Monday — five days after Maria made landfall — for the first senior administration officials from Washington to touch down to survey the damage firsthand. And only after White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert and FEMA Director Brock Long returned to Washington did the administration leap into action.\n\nTrump presided over a Situation Room meeting on the federal and local efforts Tuesday, and late in the day, the White House added a Cabinet-level meeting on Hurricane Maria to the president’s schedule.\n\nWhite House aides say the president was updated on progress in the recovery efforts through the weekend, and an administration official said Vice President Pence talked with Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress, Jenniffer González-Colón, over the weekend. Trump spoke to Gov. Ricardo Rosselló after Maria made landfall and again Tuesday; he spoke to González-Colón for the first time Wednesday.\n\nThe administration still fumbled at key moments after stepping up its response. A week after landfall, Trump still had not waived the Jones Act, a law that barred foreign-flagged vessels from delivering aid to Puerto Rico. Such a waiver had been granted for previous hurricanes this year.\n\nAsked why his administration had delayed in issuing the waiver, Trump said Wednesday that “a lot of shippers and . . . a lot of people that work in the shipping industry” didn’t want it lifted.\n\n“If this is supposed to be the ‘drain the swamp’ president, then don’t worry about the lobbyists and do what’s needed and waive the act,” said James Norton, a former deputy assistant homeland security secretary under President George W. Bush who oversaw disaster response for the agency. “We’re talking about people here.”\n\nTrump waived the law Thursday.\n\nAfter getting good marks from many for his administration’s response to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, Trump has struggled to find the right tone to address the harsher reviews after Maria. He has repeatedly praised his administration’s actions, telling reporters Friday that it has “been incredible the results that we’ve had with respect to loss of life” in Puerto Rico. The official death toll is 16, a number that is expected to rise.\n\n“We have done an incredible job considering there’s absolutely nothing to work with,” Trump said as he was leaving the White House for another weekend at Bedminster.\n\nAt the same time, he said that “the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort . . . will be funded and organized,” and he referred to the “tremendous amount of existing debt” on the island.\n\nTrump’s top disaster-response aides have blanketed television in recent days in an attempt to reset the narrative. Duke, the acting DHS secretary, told reporters Thursday outside the White House that Puerto Rico was a “good news story.” The comment seemed to unleash pent-up fury from at least one local official, after days of offering praise to the Trump administration in an apparent effort to secure more federal help.\n\n“I am asking the president of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said at a news conference Friday. “I am done being polite, I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell. . . . We are dying here. If we don’t get the food and the water into the people’s hands, we are going to see something close to a genocide.”\n\nTrump’s rosy assessment of the federal response has also contrasted sharply with the comments of federal officials on the ground.\n\nArmy Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who was named this week to lead recovery efforts, told reporters Friday that there were not enough people and assets to help Puerto Rico combat what has become a humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nThe military has significantly stepped up its mobilization to the island commonwealth, with dozens more aircraft and thousands of soldiers bringing “more logistical support” to a struggling recovery effort that has been delayed by geographical and tactical challenges.\n\nBuchanan said that Defense Department forces have been in place since before the storm lashed Puerto Rico but that the arrival of additional resources is part of the natural shift in operations. Sometimes troops act ahead of the local government to meet needs, but they were also waiting for an “actual request” from territorial officials to bring in more resources. Buchanan will bring together land forces, including the Puerto Rico National Guard, to begin pushing into the interior of the island, where aid has been slowed by washed-out roads and difficult terrain. The Navy previously led the military response in Puerto Rico.\n\n“No, it’s not enough, and that’s why we are bringing a lot more,” the three-star general said of the resources in Puerto Rico thus far.\n\nArelis R.

                  "text": "<p>In the wake of Hurricane Maria, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz has been a visible presence on the ground in the Puerto Rican capital. She's been seen comforting nursing home residents, wading in the floodwaters, and pleading for more aid during news conferences and TV appearances.\n\nShe also hasn't been afraid to assert herself — a trait the 54-year-old mayor of Puerto Rico's largest city has staked her political career on.\n\nOn Friday, she dismissed remarks made by Elaine Duke, Homeland Security's acting director, who drew sharp rebuke after saying the federal response is a \"good news story.\"\n\nShe also told reporters that after days of bureaucratic \"inefficiency,\" she was \"done being politically correct. I am mad as hell.\"\n\nWhen President Donald Trump snapped back in a series of tweets Saturday morning for her \"poor leadership ability,\" Cruz stood her ground. She said on MSNBC that she will \"compliment the people I need to compliment and call out the people I need to call out.\"\n\n\"This isn't about me,\" she added, \"this is about lives that are being lost.\"\n\nWhile Trump also accused Cruz of playing partisan politics and working with Democrats, the mayor tried to stay out of the fray. But as she finds herself thrust into the international spotlight, she has also acknowledged in past interviews how making strides as a female politician is challenging.\n\nIn 2014, two years after winning election to become the mayor of her hometown, she told the news outlet City & State New York that \"politics is a rough game, and sometimes as females we are taught that you have to play nice. Sometimes you can't play nice ... .\"\n\nPuerto Rican Mayor Carmen Yul?n works on restoring resources and helping victims of Hurricane Maria.\n\nHer interest in politics began young, first as president of her San Juan high school student council and school representative at a presidential youth summit.\n\nShe left Puerto Rico to study at Boston University and graduated with honors before earning a master's degree in public management and policy at Carnegie Mellon University. She went on to work in human resources and management departments at various companies, including Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Colgate-Palmolive and Cellular One.\n\nRelated: Delayed Response to Puerto Rico Has Echoes of Katrina for Some\n\nFrom there, she had roles in Scotiabank and the U.S. Department of Treasury. But her island was beckoning.\n\nAfter 12 years on the mainland, she returned to get involved in Puerto Rico's political affairs. She became an adviser for then-San Juan Mayor Sila Maria Calderon as well as then-president of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives, Carlos Vizcarrondo Irizarry.\n\nWith her time spent in the U.S., Cruz said she felt the pull of both American and Puerto Rican culture.\n\n\"I've come to understand — I don't know who said it — but we really are one nation divided by one ocean,\" she told City & State.\n\nPuerto Rican Mayor Carmen Yul?n works on restoring resources and helping victims of Hurricane Maria.\n\nWith her behind-the-scenes experience in politics, she decided it was time to step up herself. In 2000, she ran for Puerto Rico's House of Representatives on the Popular Democratic Party ticket — one of the island's main political parties — but lost. In 2008, she tried again and won.\n\nIn 2012, she turned to another political stage: mayor of San Juan, a city of about 400,000 people.\n\nDuring the race, she attracted members of the LGBT community, students, lower-class workers and immigrants. She propelled herself as a candidate advocating for gender equality, universal health care and rights for people with disabilities — an alternative to 12-year incumbent Jorge Santini, who openly mocked her candidacy, and his New Progressive Party.\n\nShe beat Santini by about 11,000 votes, becoming the city's third female mayor.\n\nRelated: Mass Exodus From Puerto Rico Feared After Hurricane and Debt Crisis\n\nThe next day, the local news outlet El Nuevo Día proclaimed, \"The girl triumphed over the hawk.\"\n\nCruz, who won reelection in 2016, believes that Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory and not seek independence or statehood. Her views remain in contrast to Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, the president of the New Progressive Party, which is advocating for statehood.\n\nWhile Cruz has found popularity in some corners of her city, an El Nuevo Día survey of 1,000 Puerto Ricans conducted in May found that 24 percent of respondents approved of her performance, while 46 percent disapproved. The majority found her to be irresponsible after she pushed for a national strike in May against looming austerity measures, according to the poll.\n\nBut now, Cruz is being put to the biggest test since taking office, as lack of electricity, proper shelter, and dwindling food and fuel plague the island of 3.4 million residents.\n\n\"My people's lives are at stake,\" she told reporters Friday.\n\nCruz said Puerto Ricans require more federal aid and manpower to recuperate from the aftermath of Maria, the most powerful storm to strike the Caribbean island in 90 years. As 10,000 federal workers were dispatched to there, the Trump administration installed three-star Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan to lead U.S. military operations.\n\n\"Gen. Buchanan, a three-star general, has said that he doesn't have enough troops and he doesn't have enough equipment,\" Cruz said on MSNBC after Trump criticized her on Twitter.\n\n\"So who am I? I'm just a little mayor from the capital of San Juan,\" she said. \"This is a three-star general saying he doesn't have the appropriate amount of tools.\"\n\nCruz may get to tell Trump what she thinks to his face after the president said he plans to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday. The mayor said she would be \"very glad\" to meet with him if he wants.\n\n\"I am not going to be distracted by small comments, by politics, by petty issues,\" she said. \"Whomever is here to help, whomever says things that can help, will be praised. Whomever doesn't, will not.\"</p>",

                  "text": "<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — I was stunned as I walked through the darkened and humid arrivals terminal at San Juan's International Airport two days after Hurricane Maria blasted its way across Puerto Rico.\n\nIt was quiet. No military air traffic control units on the tarmac directing planeloads of aid supplies, no bustling command center sending convoys of trucks to hard-hit areas. No mountains of relief goods stacked and ready to be deployed where needed.\n\nThere were a couple of airport employees mopping the still-damp floors of the terminal, the only sign of life in the vast space.\n\nA Federal Emergency Management Agency guy stood at the curb smoking a cigarette as I came out looking for my ride, and we struck up a conversation. The man who gave his name as John said he and a crew from FEMA had been pre-positioned at the Intercontinental Hotel before the storm.\n\nHe told me they had spent the night moving from room to room as the ferocious winds tore chunks off the building. They ended up in the stairwell, which he said \"was like a waterfall, the water gushing down the stairs like class 5 rapids.\"\n\n\"Where,\" I asked, \"is the cavalry?\" ''This is it,\" he replied, pointing to several dozen National Guard pilots and support people, along with several dozen local and federal officials milling around the Forward Operations Base near the civilian terminal of the airport.\n\nI covered Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Haiti earthquake of 2010, among many natural disasters over the course of 30 years in journalism.\n\nDisasters on the scale of Hurricane Maria are usually marked by the inspiring sight of thousands of military and federal emergency personnel flooding into the affected area.\n\nNavy ships offshore, dozens of helicopters and cargo planes flying overhead, military convoys heading into affected areas with supplies and repair crews.\n\nThe only traffic on the still flooded highways that Friday consisted of civilians looking for gas, food, water or loved ones in the wake of the storm.\n\nTwenty-thousand troops were sent into New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina flooded the city and surrounding areas. Thousands of foreign aid workers rushed into Haiti after the earthquake there leveled Port-Au-Prince, the capital. Within three days of that quake, the U.S. had dispatched some half-dozen ships and 5,500 soldiers and Marines.\n\nIn San Juan on Sept. 22, the only sign of relief efforts were beleaguered Puerto Rican government employees struggling to address the multitude of problems confronting the devastated island, while coping with their own losses from the storm.\n\nIn outlying areas, residents were left to fend for themselves, clearing roads, helping neighbors, sifting through the debris of their homes.\n\nOn a trip to the Guajataca Reservoir, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of San Juan, we came across a 25-year-old resident who refused to leave even though the Puerto Rico government declared an emergency evacuation, fearing the dam was about to burst and flood as many as 70,000 residents downstream.\n\nShe was pregnant and due to give birth in two days, but said she wasn't leaving because there \"was nowhere to go.\" Her husband said they were better off in their damaged home, than relying on government help. \"There is no government,\" he said, \"here I have my family and neighbors to help me.\"\n\nThe bottlenecks appeared to be easing by this weekend, with thousands of Puerto Ricans finally getting water and food rations, even if help was yet to reach many on the island of 3.4 million people.\n\nMilitary trucks carrying water bottles and other supplies began to reach even some remote parts of Puerto Rico and federal officials insisted more gains were coming soon.\n\nThe U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort has been dispatched to the island and the Trump administration has named a three-star Army general to oversee military relief efforts.\n\nGov. Ricard Rossello blamed some of the problems on difficulties in getting aid shipments out of seaports and airports that were knocked out of commission in the storm, and then distributing the supplies on debris-strewn streets.\n\nAs I departed on Wednesday, lines of desperate people trying to leave the island clogged the sweltering airport terminal. But at least the long-awaited aid flights appeared to be landing, a sign of hope things might start getting a little better for those left behind.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the Guajataca Reservoir is west, not north, of San Juan.</p>",

Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), one of four members of Congress born in Puerto Rico, said the Trump administration has done a “disgraceful job” of helping the 3.4 million Americans on the island devastated by Hurricane Maria.\n\n“I think it isn’t a good job; it’s a disgraceful job. The United States of America is the most powerful, wealthiest country in the world, and this is not a response that’s demonstrative of our power and our wealth,” Gutiérrez said, his voice breaking during an interview Friday night with CNN’s Jim Scuitto.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez: U.S. work on the ground in Puerto Rico is \"disgraceful,\" inadequate response is costing lives https://t.co/yE2txd0l6d — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 29, 2017\n\nPresident Trump has been facing mounting criticism over what some say is his administration’s slow response to Hurricane Maria. For four days after the massive hurricane made landfall, Trump and his aides remained largely silent as the storm-ravaged island struggled with lack of food, water and electricity, The Washington Post reported Friday. Earlier, the president had issued an emergency declaration and promised that all federal resources would be directed to help.\n\nLocal officials on the island, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, decried the failure to deliver basic necessities to communities across Puerto Rico and said the federal response had “collapsed.”\n\nIn response, Trump faulted the island’s “broken infrastructure & massive debt,” blamed the news media, and personally attacked Cruz. The president also praised his administration’s relief efforts, saying in a tweet Saturday that the thousands of federal workers on the island are doing a “fantastic job.”\n\nMore than 11,800 federal workers from three dozen departments and agencies are in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of recovery efforts after Hurricanes Maria and Irma, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The agency also said that millions of meals and liters of water have been provided and that more supplies are en route by air and sea.\n\nBefore Maria made landfall, more than 4,500 members of the National Guard were in Puerto Rico, administration officials said.\n\nGutiérrez, who owns a vacation property a few miles from San Juan, the capital, said the response had been inadequate.\n\n“It’s costing lives, Mr. President, of children, and the elderly and the infirmed,” Gutiérrez said of the administration’s response. “And we should begin an operation to also evacuate people from this island, especially the elderly, especially those that have sicknesses until they can return to [the] island to rebuild it.”\n\nHe also said of Trump: “I would hope that as he likes to talk about fire and the fury of the armed forces of the United States, that he bring them to Puerto Rico. Put that same fire and fury to save the people of Puerto Rico from what is going to be a disaster here on this island.”\n\nGutiérrez added, though, that there is some good news. FEMA had promised to deliver 1.7 million meals and 2.5 million liters of water to the island, he said.\n\nMoving food, water and other basic necessities to Puerto Rico’s ports and terminals is only half of the logistical challenge, as The Post reported this week. Distributing those goods to the people who need them is the other part of the problem, as damages to the trucking infrastructure and roads have also hampered relief efforts.\n\nGutiérrez, who represents many Puerto Rican constituents in Chicago, arrived on the island Friday. He is known for fiery speeches on the House floor and for regularly delivering passionate criticisms of Trump and, before him, President Barack Obama, over issues including immigration.\n\nHe is one of three Democratic congressmen who were arrested outside Trump Tower on Tuesday. Gutiérrez and Reps. Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.) and Raúl M. Grijalva (Ariz.) were protesting Trump’s decision to end an Obama-era program that provided legal protections to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nBefore he flew to Puerto Rico, Gutiérrez called for the federal government to not only meet immediate needs for food, water, medicine and shelter, but also to promise long-term investment and cooperation with the island’s government. He vowed to push Congress to appropriate funding to rebuild Puerto Rico.\n\n“The work of first responders and our military has been heroic, but the island needs more. . . . This is a public-health crisis and should be declared a health emergency by the federal government,” Gutiérrez said in a speech on the House floor. </p>",

Ricardo Rosselló, said at a news conference Monday.\n\nAnd cell-phone communication remained an issue, with mobile service returned to only about a third of the island.\n\nEven in metropolitan San Juan, cell coverage remained spotty in areas and debris from trees and other rubble lined the roads. People would pull over their cars on the shoulder of the highway near the airport in the hopes of getting cell service.\n\nBruce Sparks, 49, on the island from New York, said one benefit of Trump's visit would be that officials would have to clean up San Juan for just him.\n\nBut \"it's not going to help all the other\" regions, he said.\n\n\"It looks like more could've been done. They could've sent some things earlier,\" he said.\n\nSparks was headed to Cayagues to check in on his mother-in-law.

She last heard from her aunt on Facebook about a week after hurricane they were surviving on cookies and water they captured in buckets.\n\nShe hoped Trump's visit would be \"positive.\"\n\n\"My concern is that he takes a lot of things personal and he needs to just stay focused and if we get Puerto Rico back on its feet, it's a win on him, no matter who likes him or doesn't like him,\" Rivera Woods said.\n\nSome Puerto Ricans hoped Trump would see just how dire conditions are for those who remain.\n\n\"He'll see our needs and that we're going through a very difficult period,\" Maribel Rodriguez, 53, of the municipality of Hormigueros, said in Spanish.\n\n\"We're leaving our island right now because even the most basic services are paralyzed. Fundamental needs,\" said Rodriguez from the airport, while waiting in line for a flight to New York with her wheelchair-bound mother.\n\n\"For example, my mom has heart problems and the closest hospital is closed we had to decide to leave our island and leave behind our families,\" she said.\n\nPeople wait in the departures area of the airport on October 2, 2017 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

It's been wiped out,\" Trump said last week. \"Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\"\n\nThe trip will be Trump's fourth to a region battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the U.S. Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and whipped by winds.\n\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend briefings, visit a church, and meet with Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, as well as the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. They'll also meet with Navy and Marine Corps personnel on the flight Deck of the USS Kearsarge.\n\nEven before the storm hit on Sept. 20, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island's power lines, in a sorry state. Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island's entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads.\n\nNearly two weeks later, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access basic necessities, including food, fresh water and cash.\n\nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat the perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm's destruction in its immediate aftermath.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday the trip would focus on local recovery efforts, \"which we're fully committed to.\"\n\n\"The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\" she said.\n\nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved.\n\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and forty-five percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running.\n\nFor many, however, that isn't enough. On Monday, the nonprofit Oxfam announced that it would be taking the rare step of intervening in an American disaster, citing its outrage over what it called a \"slow and inadequate response.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj</p>",

The president shook the mayor's hand at the briefing.\n\nIn a brief exchange Cruz, who Trump has accused of playing politics, the mayor told the president, \"It's not about politics.\"\n\nLater, while touring a neighborhood outside San Juan, Trump told a family, \"Your governor and your mayor have done, really, a fantastic job.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives at Luis Muniz Air National Guard Base to survey hurricane damage and recovery efforts and shakes hands with the mayor of San Juan. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nAt that briefing, Trump praised Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló for speaking positively about the federal government's efforts on the island.\n\nThe governor is \"not even from my party,\" Trump said. \"Right from the beginning, this governor did not play politics. He didn't play it at all.\" Instead, the president said, the governor's praise was a sign that he was \"saying it like it was.\"\n\nTrump compared the 16 people who died in Puerto Rico as a result of the storm to the \"thousands\" that perished after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005.\n\n\nThe relief efforts have come at a cost, Trump pointed out to local officials at the briefing, saying that the disaster has \"thrown our budget a little out of whack\" but adding that it's worth it for all of the lives saved.\n\nThe president also called out FEMA Administrator Brock Long, grading him \"A+\" for recent relief efforts in Texas and Florida. \"Brock has been unbelievable,\" Trump said.\n\nBut, Trump added, Puerto Rico's recovery \"has been the toughest one.\"\n\nTrump pointed out the strength of the hurricane that hit the island — \"a Category Five, which few people have ever even heard of\" that he said \"hit land and, boy, did it hit land.\"\n\nResidents, many of whom have been without water, electricity, housing and basic necessities, told NBC News ahead of Trump’s arrival that he has been late in coming and that the federal government’s response has been slow.\n\nOver several stops on Tuesday, Trump took part in handing supplies out to Puerto Ricans in need and even walked door to door in one residential neighborhood outside San Juan, greeting families who were outside their homes. While distributing food, paper towels, and batteries at the Cavalry Chapel, the president remarked, \"There's a lot of love in this room.\"\n\nTrump throws rolls of paper towels into crowd of residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\nWhile the president has lauded first responders in Puerto Rico throughout the crisis, he has also lashed out at local leaders, including Cruz, who has criticized the government’s response and made public pleas to Trump to send more help.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump accused Cruz of \"such poor leadership\" and partisan-motivated attacks against him as he charged that some in Puerto Rico want \"everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\" In later tweets, he accused \"politically motivated ingrates\" and \"fake news\" of not recognizing the \"amazing work\" that the federal government has done so far in Puerto Rico.\n\nDeparting the White House earlier Tuesday, the president insisted recovery efforts were as good as those in Florida and Texas despite the \"tougher situation.\"\n\nWhile the administration has mobilized federal efforts to help, there has been widespread criticism about the speed and execution of government recovery efforts in Puerto Rico — with some even likening the situation to New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina under President George W. Bush.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are more likely to disapprove than approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the Puerto Rico hurricane relief effort.\n\nAccording to a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, just 32 percent approve of how Trump is handling disaster relief in the U.S. territory, while 49 percent disapprove.\n\n\"It took him how long to get to Puerto Rico?\" said Bree Harris, a 25-year-old chef and Democrat from Los Angeles. She suspects Trump \"didn't even know that Puerto Rico was an island that was part of America. It's embarrassing.\"\n\nTrump drew better marks for his handling of the recoveries after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Forty-eight percent of Americans approve and just 27 percent disapprove of Trump's handling of recoveries in U.S. states, including Texas and Florida.\n\nThe poll was conducted before Trump on Tuesday made his first trip to Puerto Rico, an island 1,000 miles from the mainland, after Hurricane Maria roared ashore Sept. 20 and knocked out all power. The federal response has drawn criticism and the administration has aggressively pushed back.\n\nAfter lavishing attention and time on Texas and Florida, Trump tweeted his wish for Puerto Ricans to \"be careful\" just before the storm hit, but then didn't talk publicly about the island's post-hurricane struggles for days as he chose instead to fight with the NFL over some of its players kneeling for the national anthem. Critics said the president had failed to grasp the magnitude of Maria's destruction as quickly as he had the twin wallops of Harvey and Irma.\n\nA week later, Trump publicly tuned in to Maria's aftermath. He sent multiple administration officials out to defend his response. He called briefings and meetings and insisted that helping Puerto Ricans was a top priority.\n\nBut Trump also suggested their suffering was partly the fault of officials who had allowed the island's infrastructure and economy to degrade before the hurricanes and said local people should be doing more to help the recovery.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said that \"we're going to have to wipe out\" Puerto Rico's debt.\n\n\"We're going to work something out,\" he said. \"We have to look at their whole debt structure. You know, they owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street. And we're going to have to wipe that out.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, however, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney appeared to walk back Trump's remarks, telling reporters \"we are not going to be offering a bailout for Puerto Rico or for its current bondholders.\"\n\nWidespread disasters offer presidents much to gain — or lose — politically as they try to play the role of comforter while competently leading the government's response to life-and-death issues for masses of Americans.\n\n\"He didn't do a tremendous job in the states, but it's not quite as disturbing and horrific as his response in Puerto Rico,\" said Tara Blesh-Boren, 34, a registered independent from Lincoln, Nebraska. \"He is so busy getting his ego involved in these ridiculous back-and-forth arguments about things that don't matter to anyone but him that he is really not managing our country.\"\n\nThe poll includes responses from people in all states, but not in Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories.\n\nWhile some Puerto Ricans expressed appreciation for Trump's visit on Tuesday, others said they were frustrated with the pace of the recovery — and the tone of some of the president's remarks.\n\nOfficials say 93 percent of the island still lacks electricity. In the capital, San Juan, where most neighborhoods remain without power, pastry chef Rose Cisneros said her family is faring well but she worries about communities in the island's mountainous interior that are still struggling to access food and clean water.\n\n\"I am grateful the military is helping. I wish it could be even more,\" Cisneros said, adding that she's been frustrated to hear Trump bring up Puerto Rico's debt and the cost to the federal government for the recovery effort.\n\nWater service has been restored to about half of customers across the island, according to the governor, who has said he hopes 25 percent of electricity customers will have power by the end of October. Officials have said power would be restored to the entire island before March. Many stores have opened, including half of the island's grocery stores, but many have run out of basic supplies and lines are still long.\n\nThe poll shows partisan divisions on Trump's handling of disaster relief, but Republicans and Democrats alike are more likely to approve of Trump's handling of the situation in Texas and Florida than in Puerto Rico.\n\nAmong Republicans, 76 percent approve of Trump's disaster response stateside while 62 percent approve of how he's handling the situation in Puerto Rico. Among Democrats, 30 percent approve of how Trump is handling the situations in Florida and Texas while just 11 percent approve of how he's handling the situation in Puerto Rico.\n\nTwo in 10 whites, 4 in 10 Hispanics and nearly 6 in 10 African-Americans disapprove of the president's response in U.S. states. But 4 in 10 whites, 6 in 10 Hispanics and nearly 8 in 10 blacks disapprove of the response in Puerto Rico.\n\nNearly 9 in 10 Democrats and 7 in 10 Republicans say the U.S. government has a major responsibility to help disaster victims in U.S. territories.\n\nAccording to the survey, more than 4 in 10 Americans say they or their friends or family were seriously impacted by this year's hurricanes, including 8 percent who say they were personally impacted and another 34 percent who say that friends or family members were seriously impacted.\n\nMany say they've taken part in charitable activities in response to the recent storms, including 55 percent who gave money, clothing or other items to charity, 11 percent who did extra volunteer work and 9 percent who donated blood or tried to do so.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Melia in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kellman and Swanson on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/APLaurieKellman and http://www.Twitter.com/EL_Swan\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,150 adults was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 2 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

                  "text": "<p>The Puerto Rico that President Trump saw during his four-hour visit on Tuesday afternoon was that of Angel Pérez Otero, the mayor of Guaynabo, a wealthy San Juan suburb known for its amenity-driven gated communities that was largely spared when Hurricane Maria hit nearly two weeks ago.\n\nPérez Otero led Trump and his entourage on a walking tour of a neighborhood, where high-speed winds had blown out some second-story windows and knocked over a few trees — but where life seemed to be returning to normal, thanks to assistance from the government. Neighbors stood outside their homes ready to warmly greet the president, their phones powered up and ready to snap photos.\n\nOne homeowner told Trump that he lost a couple windows and still hasn’t regained electricity, but he was never worried about his family’s safety.\n\n“We have a good house, thank God,” he told the president.\n\n“That’s fantastic,” Trump said. “Well, we’re going to help you out. Have a good time.”\n\nIf the president had traveled a little deeper into the island, to the communities that sustained some of the heaviest damage, he would have witnessed a very different Puerto Rico.\n\nJust 10 miles southeast of Guaynabo is this mountainous city of Caguas, nestled in a valley ringed by steep sierras and narrow mountain passes, with homes built densely on the edges of gravity-defying slopes. These hills were stripped naked by Maria’s malicious winds, leaving the trees without leaves and fruit, their bare branches contorted in painful postures. Houses that withstood tropical rain and wind for decades were blown off their foundations and destroyed by toppled vegetation. Twisted metal roofs landed in creeks all over the once-lush region.\n\nThe gravity of Caguas’ devastation hit Mayor William Miranda Torres when he saw the fallen ancient trees of the botanical garden where his father, the longtime Caguas mayor known as “El Viejo,” had his ashes spread after he died of cancer in 2010.\n\n“That’s when it became hard to hold back the tears,” he said. “No matter how prepared you think you are, you can’t be prepared for something like this.”\n\nIn Guaynabo, the conversations, usually in English, are growing more positive with local officials listing what they see as measures of success: All airports and nearly all ports have reopened, thousands of federal workers are on the ground, more than 65 percent of grocery and big-box stores have reopened, 64 of 68 hospitals are open, and roughly 70 percent of gas stations are operational.\n\nBut here in Caguas there remains a sense of desperation with Miranda Torres rattling off a much more dire list of statistics in Spanish: Nearly 1 in 10 residents were severely impacted by the storm’s destruction. More than 1,200 homes were flattened or suffered major damage. At least one person died at a shelter from complications of diabetes after not having access to medical care, and two people committed suicide.\n\nMany more could be dead not just in Caguas but in many rural municipalities where hospitals shut down and lifesaving medical treatment was out of reach for several days. And it’s unclear how many people drowned in flooding or were trapped by mounds of tumbling mud.\n\nHomes and infrastructure lie in ruins outside the city of Caguas, Puerto Rico on Tuesday. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\n‘Nothing short of miracle’\n\nAfter the neighborhood tour in Guaynabo, Trump traveled to the nearby Calvary Chapel, an evangelical church that’s especially popular with conservatives and mainland Americans who have moved to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe church, which has a number of locations across the United States, has received large shipments of donated food, water and survival gear to distribute. Members track these donations on a the church Facebook page. On Thursday, meals arrived on a chartered plane. On Sunday, 7,000 pounds of food arrived at the airport. On Monday, six pallets of food. The church is awaiting the arrival of a shipping container packed with more than 40,000 pounds of food and supplies.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the church told its Facebook followers that they expected a visit from the mayor and Puerto Rico’s governor “along with other special guests.”\n\n“Everyone is invited — especially if you and your family are in need,” the church wrote.\n\nStanding outside the church with a group of reporters, Trump said the government response here “has been something like I’ve never seen before.”\n\n“What has happened in terms of recovery, what has happened in terms of saving lives — 16 lives, that’s a lot, but we compare that to the thousands of people that died in other hurricanes that were not nearly as severe,” Trump said, citing an official death toll that was several days old.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visit residents affected by Hurricane Maria in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico on Tuesday. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt wasn’t until after Air Force One took off Tuesday that the government updated its official death toll from 16 to 34, allowing reality to once again settle on an island that maneuvered itself into the most flattering light possible for the president’s visit.\n\nThroughout the day, Trump was surrounded by local government officials willing to back up his assertions.\nGuaynabo’s mayor, Pérez Otero, said that mayors need to do all that they can for their residents instead of blaming problems on the federal government. Over the weekend, Pérez Otero came to Trump’s defense when San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz accused the administration of not doing enough to help. In interviews with conservative outlets, Pérez Otero accused Cruz of not participating in relief efforts like other mayors have, an attack Trump quickly adopted.\n\n“Your people are doing the right stuff for us,” Pérez Otero told Trump on Tuesday. “And that’s my experience over here in Guaynabo in the helping of thousands and thousands of people. So thank you, thank you, Mr. President.”\n\nA reporter asked the president if he had a message for Puerto Ricans who still don’t have power, food or clean water.\n\n“The power grid, honestly, was devastated before the hurricanes even hit — and then the hurricanes hit and they wiped them out,” Trump said, adding that numerous generators have brought the island back to life. “Again, the job that’s been done here is, really, nothing short of a miracle. It has been incredible.”\n\nWilliam Miranda Torres, the mayor of Caguas, hugs a girl whose dog was just run over. Torres was on a driving tour around his afflicted city. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, in nearby Caguas, Miranda Torres was trying to make up for lost time. In the 48 hours after the hurricane, communication was impossible. Since then, he has lost count of how many times he traveled to San Juan to tell the central government what his people needed: food, water and generators. But it took more than a week for a trickle of supplies to reach the town.\n\nFor days, the shelters had no generators. The hospitals were without water. And the help wasn’t coming quickly enough because the roads were covered in mud and debris.\n\n“We would tell we them needed tarps for roofless homes and they’d say, ’Okay, let’s do it,’” Miranda Torres said. “But then they didn’t have anyone to drive the trucks to deliver the supplies. I’d go to the command center to spend four or five hours there listening and advocating for my city. It was frustrating.”\n\nTactically, federal and Puerto Rico authorities had the right idea, he said. Logistically, the operation failed.\n\nMiranda Torres and other local leaders went to work identifying and solving problems.\n\nResidents could not get out of their barrios because of fallen debris, so within a week the city government and workers cleared every winding mountain road. Nearly 700 senior citizens in home care or nursing homes did not have care and food, so volunteers went into all the barrios to locate bedridden seniors who needed help. Hundreds of people did not have enough of their medication to get through the week, so the municipal government coordinated directly with local pharmacies to sort through inventory and facilitate deliveries of specific medications to residents.\n\nWithin a week, the city government cleared every winding mountain road, documented 512 cases of destroyed homes and set up feeding stations to serve hot meals to residents. Volunteers went into all the barrios to locate bedridden seniors who needed help.\n\nIn the San Salvador neighborhood, 19 people are living in elementary school classrooms, and the local lunch ladies volunteered to cook for them on Tuesday, serving up rice and beans, pork and peaches, along with a glass of milk. Across the region, neighbors are pooling together the food they do have — sweet potatoes from their gardens, bread and plantains found in the brush.\n\nNeighbors have been hugging and comforting one another. City staff already know some children and residents will need psychological counseling.\n\n“You see them there smiling and chatting, then all of a sudden they go silent,” said Madeline Gonzalez, who oversees the meal preparation at the San Salvador shelter. “You know they are depressed.”\n\nTwo men carry packages of water bottles in Caguas. Water has been in short supply. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\n‘Flashlights — you don’t need ‘em anymore’\n\nTrump continued into the church, where he was greeted by several dozen church members and others who cheered his arrival. A few people in the crowd shouted that they loved him or held signs that read: “Proud Americans,” “Let’s Make Puerto Rico Great Again” and “God bless You, Mr. President.” At least one person wore a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nTrump shook hands, posed for selfies and examined some of the supplies stockpiled at the church — bags of rice, solar-powered flashlights, bottled water, rolls of paper towels and cans of chicken.\n\n“Whoa! I’ve never seen that before,” Trump said, holding up a can of chicken. “That looks kind of good. Let’s start handing it out. Do you feel like this?”\n\nBut few in the camera-wielding crowd appeared to be in need of a can of chicken. Trump moved down the line to the flashlights, asking the crowd who wanted one. He tried out one of the larger models, shining it at the television cameras and the crowd as if it were a spotlight.\n\nAs he handed out some smaller flashlights, he declared: “Flashlights — you don’t need ‘em anymore. You don’t need ‘em anymore.”\n\nTrump passed out yellow bags of rice and then started tossing rolls of towels into the crowd as if he were shooting free-throws. The crowd laughed and cheered him on. When he contemplated doing the same with the cans of chicken, the crowd gently told him no.\n\nThe church is also distributing water purification kits, and a member explained the process to the president.\n\n“Wait,” Trump said, “you put it in dirty water?”\n\n“And then you can drink it after 10 to 12 hours,” she explained.\n\n“Would you do it? Would you drink it?” he asked.\n\n“Sure,” she said.\n\n“Really?” Trump said, a disgusted look coming across his face.\n\n“Really,” she said.\n\n“Is this your company or something?” Trump asked the woman, seeming suspicious of the aggressive pitch.\n\n“No,” she said, “I’m part of the church.”\n\n“This is an interesting thing,” Trump said, as he started to hand out the kits. “Try that.”\n\nIn Caguas, the mayor and his staff met at city hall to discuss how best to distribute the next shipment of water from the federal government — whenever it arrives.\n\n“Are they sending us the gallons or the small bottles?” Miranda Torres asked his secretary of human development, Aida Gonzalez. She thinks it will be 16-ounce bottles.\n\nIn remote areas like Caguas, drinkable water is often scarce, although there is some water service and residents have been catching rainwater in cisterns. Across the island, only about half of residents have access to clean drinking water.\n\n“Water is health here,” he said. “If people don’t have it for hygiene and the like, they are going to start getting sick.”\n\nWater often seems like the most pressing community need, but Miranda Torres has found there are so many others. As he toured the barrios of Borinquen and Tomas de Castro on Tuesday afternoon, a dog ran out into the road and its head was crushed by a passing vehicle. A little girl’s shrieks pierced the air.\n\nThe mayor pulled over, jumped out of his Chevy Tahoe to take the child into his arms. He held her tight as she wailed into his shoulder. It was different kind of tragedy that had befallen this family but within the sphere of duties for Miranda Torres that day.\n\nWalking back to his vehicle, Miranda Torres barely made it three steps before he was greeted by a resident sticking out their hand for a handshake or pining for a moment to tell him what they needed.\n\nThe needs, big and small, seem endless.\n\n“If Trump wanted to see the real Puerto Rico,” said Caguas’ vice-mayor Lydia Rivera Denizard, “he should’ve come here.”</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Late each night, Rafael Surillo Ruiz, the mayor of a town with one of Puerto Rico’s most critical ports, drives for miles on darkened roads, easing around downed power lines and crumpled tree branches — to check his email.\n\nAt the wheel of his “guagua”— local slang for an SUV — he sometimes finds a spotty cellphone signal on a highway overpass, and there he sits, often for hours, scrolling through messages. During the day, with no working landline and no Internet access, he operates more like a 19th-century mayor of Yabucoa, orchestrating the city’s business in an information vacuum, dispatching notes scrawled on slips of paper — about everything from balky generators to misdirected water deliveries — that he hands to runners.\n\nOn the other side of the mayor’s favorite overpass spot, one of the generators at the area’s biggest hospital has collapsed from exhaustion, and the frazzled staff has stopped admitting new patients. Deeper into the island’s mountainous interior, thirsty Puerto Ricans draw drinking water from the mud-caked crevasses of roadside rock formations and bathe in creeks too small to have names.\n\n“We feel completely abandoned here,” Surillo Ruiz said with a heavy sigh.\n\nIt has been three weeks since Hurricane Maria savaged Puerto Rico, and life in the capital city of San Juan inches toward something that remotely resembles a new, uncomfortable form of normalcy. Families once again loll on the shaded steps of the Mercado de Santurce traditional market on a Sunday afternoon, and a smattering of restaurants and stores open their doors along sidewalks still thick with debris and tangled power lines.\n\nBut much of the rest of the island lies in the chokehold of a turgid, frustrating and perilous slog toward recovery.\n\nCars pass a damaged area in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, on Sept. 29. (Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen night comes, the vast majority of this 100-mile long, 35-mile wide island plunges into profound darkness, exposing the impotence of a long-troubled power grid that was tattered by Maria’s winds and rains. Eighty-four percent of the island is still without power, according to the governor’s office, and local officials in many areas are steeling themselves — with a sense of anger and dread — for six months or more without electricity.\n\nRoughly half of Puerto Ricans have no working cellphone service, creating islands of isolation within the island and cutting off hundreds of thousands of people in regions outside the largest metropolitan areas from regular contact with their families, aid groups, medical care and the central government. Christine Enid Nieves Rodriguez, who has set up a community kitchen near the southeastern city of Humacao, has dubbed the new reality Puerto Rico’s “dystopian future.”\n\nDebris covers the interior of a building with a destroyed roof at the Palma Real Shopping Center in Humacao on Sept. 22, two days after Hurricane Maria devastated large areas of Puerto Rico. (Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/for The Washington Post)\n\nAttendant with that future are worries about outbreaks of waterborne diseases, such as scabies or Zika, which is transmitted by mosquitoes breeding in standing water. Just 63 percent of the island’s residents have access to clean drinking water, and just 60 percent of wastewater treatment plants are working, according to figures released by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIn poorer communities, such as the San Juan neighborhood of Carolina and the mountain town of Canovanas, doctors are seeing worrying numbers of patients with conjunctivitis and gastritis brought on by contaminated water and poor hygiene.\n\nWith electrical and cellphone outages complicating commerce, large swaths of the island — and even many spots within the biggest cities — are cash-only zones, as if credit cards never existed. More than 40 percent of bank branches have yet to reopen, according to the governor’s office, and barely more than 560 ATMs are functioning for an island with a population of more than 3.4 million.\n\nOn the upside, chronic gasoline shortages that plagued the early days after the storm seem to be easing, at least in the larger cities, and 86 percent of grocery stores have reopened. But the journey to fill the tank or the shopping cart can be an exercise in faith and blind courage. In the sprawling metropolis of San Juan, crisscrossed by major highways and multi-laned streets, most streetlights are not functioning. Only a surge of post-hurricane politeness and patience seems to be preventing the morgues from swelling with traffic deaths.\n\nThe roads leading out of San Juan are lined by denuded hillsides, their rocky, browned, frayed surfaces exposed to the sunlight. The storm acted like a blowtorch, searing off leaves and lifting away topsoil. A surreal consequence of Maria’s transformation of the island landscape is the lack of shade in once-divine town squares and jungly hinterlands.\n\nIt’s enough to make many Puerto Ricans consider fleeing the island for good, even though the thought of leaving a place they love can still seem implausible. What awaits many of them here is months of subsistence living. In places such as the surfer haven of Playa Jobos on the northwestern coast, a woman whose wood house was blown to bits has taken to living in a disabled food truck outfitted with a hammock.\n\n“When I think about grandchildren, I know that I don’t want this for them,” said Lucy Rivera, an unemployed single mother who has crammed nine people, including her disabled mother and mentally ill brother, into a house that lost its roof in the town of Canovanas near the El Yunque National Forest.\n\nRivera has no money and her government assistance card is useless in the many businesses that have gone cash-only. So she sits in traffic for hours in a borrowed car trying to find food and get medical care.\n\nOn a recent afternoon along one of those choked Puerto Rican roads, cars jammed with children and plastic jugs pulled over to gaze at the ingenuity of Jesus Sanchez, a wiry 74-year-old retiree. Sanchez had fished a six-foot length of PVC pipe out of a ditch in Toa Alta, an ancient town 17 miles outside San Juan. He’d lashed it to a forked branch with some shredded cloth and inserted the mouth of the pipe into a crook that began gushing water in the steep limestone hillside above his head.\n\n“Now!” he called to his wife, Ana Marrero Nieves.\n\nMarrero Nieves proceeded to toss plastic jugs — empty containers that once held cranberry juice and canola oil — over to Sanchez, who clung to the muddy slope, slipping and sliding, but smiling. More than 2½ weeks had passed since the storm and he had not received any aid at their house, where the windows were blown out. But, from the hillside, he drew sustenance, just as he had done for days.\n\n“If it wasn’t for this, how many would have died?” he said.\n\nThe roads narrow as they snake up the mountains, then dip down into the jaw-dropping valleys of central Puerto Rico, passing by town after town where the wind tore roofs off nearly every humble cinder-block dwelling and splintered the yet humbler wooden shacks. Flamboyant trees that once prettied the countryside with branches lit by brilliant red flowers lie by the thousands alongside thick-trunked rubber trees. Stands of bamboo with stalks thicker than the fat end of a baseball bat form archways that scrape the roofs of all but the squattest cars.\n\nBeing miles away from the coast provided no refuge to the residents of Morovis, a town of about 30,000 residents scattered on the bluffs and ravines of north-central Puerto Rico. Zerimar Rivera, a 31-year-old mother of twin boys, couldn’t stand the smell of sweat anymore and made her way for a trickling creek south of town.\n\n“We’re going to the washboard, like in the time of our grandparents,” she called out to a friend, as she plunged a shirt into a five-gallon paint primer bucket filled with creek water and detergent. Rivera is a teacher, and like many middle- and lower-middle-class Puerto Ricans, she is only paid when she works, and she has not worked a moment since the storm hit on Sept. 20.\n\nRafael Reyes embraces his wife, Xarelis Negron, and his son, Xariel, as they stand next to their belongings in front of the remains of their home in the San Lorenzo neighborhood of Morovis, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 7. (Ramon Espinosa/AP)\n\nRivera’s dilemma is the same one faced by Eric Bonet and Sherrie Berrios, a couple that works as dog groomers in the town of Barceloneta. One day after the storm, Berrios says they were hungry and thirsty when Bonet turned to her and said, “I think I’m going to turn the car into a pickup truck.”\n\nThe next thing she knew, Bonet had stripped the seats out of the back of their 1994 Nissan Altima. He enlisted a buddy to join them and stuffed some couch cushions in the back so Berrios would have a place to sit, and they were off in search of aluminum.\n\nIn Morovis, they scored big time, rifling through a pile of garbage across from an outdoor bar until they found an old-fashioned restaurant sign with an aluminum frame. Bonet ripped it off with an eight-inch Ginsu kitchen knife and added the loot to the rest of the treasures they had strapped to the car’s roof. Days of work earned them $140 at 30 cents a pound.\n\nThere is almost no place on the island where the enterprising scavenger couple couldn’t stand a decent chance of adding to their pile. The storm was so brutish and so wide that it spread across the length and breadth of the island, damaging at least 60,000 homes, according to government estimates that some here consider far below the real figure. But only one place can claim it’s the spot where Maria first made landfall, and that is down along the southeastern coast near Yabucoa, where Mayor Surillo Ruiz reigns.\n\nYabucoa sits in a wide fertile valley, which is perfect for growing plantains, but also an ideal funnel for hurricanes. On an incline overlooking the valley, Carmen Manso presides at a senior center that doubles as a local museum inside a grand century-old house with wide wood beams and tile floors that resemble a checkerboard. Her handful of clients, including several who served in the U.S. military, stick to the lower floor because the storm tore off much of the building’s roof, exposing upstairs rooms filled with paintings, artifacts and beds.\n\n“When it rains, this is like Niagara Falls,” Manso says with a chuckle. She doesn’t have much choice but to laugh. One morning she set off with several of her clients’ ATM cards so she could withdraw money for them.\n\nShe drove 25 minutes to the town of Humacao, but the bank was closed.\n\nShe drove another half-hour to the town of Gurabo, but they had run out of money.\n\nShe pressed on another 20 minutes down the road and arrived at a bank in Caguas. The line at the ATM trailed down the street; 2½ hours later, she finally was able to pull out some cash for her clients. And she still had to drive home.\n\nShe returned to a place where the mayor had been run out of city hall by storm winds that punched a massive, jagged hole in the roof, turning the building into an outsize, end-to-end pass-through window. Mayor Surillo Ruiz now operates out of a small conference room in his town’s medical clinic. He got a satellite phone as government recovery aid, but he can’t make it work — a complaint other mayors with similar technological problems have echoed.\n\nOn his nightly trip in search of a cellphone signal, Surillo Ruiz keeps hearing from people in the mainland United States who want to help his town. One night it was Ricky Martin, the heartthrob Puerto Rican singer whose foundation has been active in the relief effort. But Surillo Ruiz really doesn’t know how to respond to most requests. He has little faith, he says, that aid intended for Yabucoa will make it to Yabucoa — he worries it will either be misappropriated due to corruption or mishandled due to incompetence or confusion.\n\nHe worries even more about the potential for a health crisis. The nearest full-scale medical center — Ryder Memorial Hospital, a 103-year-old nonprofit institution — is 13 hard-driving miles away. The hospital, too, is cut off from the world.\n\n“When people say send me an email, I say, ‘What? By smoke signals!’ ” said Deana Hallman, Ryder’s medical director.\n\nHallman and other hospital executives were unstinting in their criticism of Puerto Rico’s health secretary, Rafael Rodriguez Mercado, accusing him of wasting time “assigning blame” to others and sowing “divisiveness.” Health Department officials have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nOne of Ryder’s generators failed a few days ago, and several critical patients had to be airlifted to a U.S. Navy hospital ship. By last weekend, the other generators, which according to the hospital’s protocols are not supposed to run for more than seven days, had been going for 17.\n\nBy chance, Hallman was passing through an area with cell coverage a few days ago, and she lurched her car to a stop. An administrator at another hospital told her about a meeting with government health officials in San Juan, a gathering that was supposed to be an opportunity for the government to tell hospitals what it could do to help them.\n\nEach hospital got a sheet listing the aid it would receive following government assessments of their needs.\n\nSome of the lists were long. Ryder’s was short.\n\nIt had just one item: diesel.\n\nThere was only one problem: Ryder had not been asking for diesel, Hallman said. It had plenty.\n\nInstead, they had been asking — over and over, through 10 site visits by Puerto Rican and federal officials — for an electrical grid fix that would end their reliance on generators.\n\n“The government just needs to put the grid back,” Lirio Torres Sepulveda, a Ryder executive said. “That’s their job.”</p>",

                  "text": "<p>IT HAS been three weeks since Hurricane Maria made devastating landfall in Puerto Rico. Three weeks — and 84 percent of the population is still without power. Only 63 percent have access to clean water, and only 60 percent of wastewater treatment plants are working. Food supplies are spotty, the health-care system is in crisis, and people are dying. The death toll has risen to 45.\n\nIf the Americans enduring these conditions lived in Connecticut or Montana or Arkansas, would we be counseling patience? Would we be blithely accepting predictions of another month — or more — to get the power restored? No. There would be unending media coverage, people would be furious — and the president of the United States certainly wouldn’t be threatening to abandon federal relief efforts.\n\nThe state of affairs would simply be seen as unacceptable, which it is. The 3.4 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico are owed a far better response from their government than they have gotten these past three weeks.\n\nConditions on the island remain grim and, in some instances, have been exacerbated by the delay in getting help. Post reporters detailed an island plunged into darkness with roads impassable, communications knocked out and the economy at a standstill. The New York Times detailed the impacts on health care, with hospitals running low on medicine, seriously ill patients going without proper treatment and an increasing risk of people getting sick — and dying — from contaminated water. The Guardian reported on food shortages, with federal emergency workers unable to meet the demand for providing meals. “We feel completely abandoned here,” the mayor of Yabucoa told Post reporters.\n\nMaria was the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century. There is no minimizing its catastrophic effects, nor the logistical challenges of getting help to an island already suffering from poor infrastructure and long-standing financial problems. But none of that excuses the federal government’s sluggish response and poor planning. Why, for example, as the Times reported, were only 82 patients sent to the medical treatment ship Comfort over six days when there were so many more sick people in peril?\n\nYet, almost in­cred­ibly, President Trump on Thursday blasted out a trio of tweets trying to shame the U.S. territory for its current problems and putting its residents on notice that the federal government might pull out. So much for his promise to “be there every day” until the people of Puerto Rico are “safe and sound and secure.”\n\nIt is time to stop treating the people of Puerto Rico like second-class citizens. Congress should give Puerto Rico the resources it needs. It also should exercise its oversight over the administration to demand answers on why, three weeks after disaster struck, so many Americans are still living in misery with so little hope for the future.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Dorado, Puerto Rico (CNN) Jose Luis Rodriguez waited in line Friday to fill plastic jugs in the back of his pickup truck with water for drinking, doing the dishes and bathing.\n\nBut there is something about this water Rodriguez didn't know: It was being pumped to him by water authorities from a federally designated hazardous-waste site, CNN learned after reviewing Superfund documents and interviewing federal and local officials.\n\nRodriguez, 66, is so desperate for water that this news didn't startle him.\n\n\"I don't have a choice,\" he said. \"This is the only option I have.\"\n\nMore than three weeks after Hurricane Maria ravaged this island, more than 35% of the island's residents -- American citizens -- remain without safe drinking water.\n\nIt's clear some residents are turning to potentially risky sources to get by.\n\nFriday afternoon, CNN watched workers from the Puerto Rican water utility, Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, or AAA, distribute water from a well at the Dorado Groundwater Contamination Site, which was listed in 2016 as part of the federal Superfund program for hazardous waste cleanup.\n\nResidents like Rodriguez filled small bottles from a hose and piled them in their vehicles. Large trucks with cylindrical tanks on their backs carried the water to people elsewhere. Some of the trucks carried the name of the municipality of Dorado. Others simply were labeled with the words \"Agua Potable,\" Spanish for potable water.\n\nIn announcing the addition of the Dorado site to the Superfund program, the US Environmental Protection Agency says the area was polluted with industrial chemicals, including tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene, which \"can have serious health impacts including damage to the liver and increasing the risk of cancer,\" according to the EPA.\n\nIt's unclear whether there are public health risks from this particular well, however.\n\nThe EPA said it plans to do testing in the area over the weekend.\n\n\"The EPA is gathering more information about the quality of water from the wells associated with our Dorado groundwater contamination site, as well as other Superfund sites in Puerto Rico,\" the agency said in a statement issued to CNN on Friday. \"While some of these wells are sometimes used to provide drinking water, the EPA is concerned that people could be drinking water that may be contaminated, depending on the well. We are mindful of the paramount job of protecting people's health, balanced with people's basic need for water.\"\n\nRegional EPA spokesman Elias Rodriguez confirmed the location is part of a Superfund site.\n\nAutoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, the water authority, was unaware that this well site was part of the Superfund program until CNN provided maps showing that this was the case, according to Luis Melendez, sub-director for environmental compliance at the utility.\n\nMelendez maintained the water is fit for public consumption. The well was opened on an emergency basis and is not part of the regular drinking water supply, he said.\n\nIn 2015, this well in Dorado, which is located near a shopping center, was found by the EPA to be safely within federal standards for PCE and chloroform, two industrial chemicals.\n\n'I've never seen this before'\n\nMartyn Smith, a professor of toxicology at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN the levels of PCE and chloroform would be essentially safe for human consumption. \"I wouldn't have any problem in drinking this water if these were the only chemicals in it,\" he said. The problem with Superfund sites, he said, is that you don't know what else is present.\n\n\"I've never seen this before,\" he said, referring to the idea a Superfund site would be used as a source of public drinking water. Boiling the water, he said, would reduce possible contamination. And it's somewhat understandable, Smith added, that people in Puerto Rico would turn to possibly questionable drinking water sources given the scope of the crisis.\n\nStill, a Superfund site -- a location with known health risks -- is just about the last place a person would want to turn to find drinking water, even in a crisis, said Erik Olson, head of the health program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.\n\n\"There are thousands of chemicals out there that could be in a Superfund site and only a relative handful are covered by standards,\" he said. \"What I would be worried about is stuff that isn't showing up on EPA's drinking water standards. It just sounds really risky to me to be serving water out of a Superfund well.\"\n\nPeople waiting in line for water on Friday were largely unaware of these concerns. Some of them had heard the EPA announced this week that it had received reports that Puerto Ricans were getting water from Superfund sites. But those interviewed assumed that wasn't this well.\n\nMayra Perez, a 59-year-old retiree, expressed pride in the quality of the water.\n\n\"I'm sure there are no chemicals in this water,\" she said.\n\nAixa Chevere, a mother of two, said she would find a new source of water if this site was shown to be contaminated. Already, the family spends three to four hours per day waiting in lines for basic services and goods, including water. \"We would boil the water or search for bottled water\" if it were dangerous, she said. \"We would find some other alternative.\"\n\nThat day, however, she loaded the water into her trunk of her car.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>President Trump suggested Wednesday that former FBI director James B. Comey had intended to spare Democrat Hillary Clinton from prosecution “long before investigation was complete” into her government email practices.\n\nIn a pair of early-morning Twitter messages, Trump referred to a recently released Justice Department document that indicates a draft of a Comey statement about the investigation was circulating among aides in May last year, two months before Comey announced the end of the investigation and his decision not to seek charges.\n\nWow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017\n\n...people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017\n\nThe FBI posted the document to its “Vault” Freedom of Information Act reading room on Monday. The unclassified document titled “Drafts of Director Comey's July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01\" includes part of an email message from FBI official James Rybicki, who forwarded an email from Comey asking for “any comments on this statement so we may roll it into a master doc for discussion with the Director at a future date.”\n\nThe draft statement itself is redacted, as is nearly everything else in the five-page document.\n\nIt was written before investigators had interviewed several witnesses, including Clinton herself. Comey announced the closure of the investigation in July, days after Clinton's FBI interview. At issue was the security and handling of classified material on Clinton's home-based email server, which she used during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.\n\nTrump's tweets revive his feud with Comey, whom he fired in May, and the Democratic opponent he defeated last year. He has twice this week referred to Clinton as “Crooked Hillary,” his campaign trail nickname for her.\n\nTrump said Comey had “stated under oath that he didn't do this,” in apparent reference to Comey's Senate testimony in which he said there was no criminal case to bring. In his tweet Wednesday, Trump asked, “Where is Justice Dept?” apparently inviting an investigation into the existence of the 2016 email chain.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have said the FBI email chain shows that Comey began drafting an “exoneration statement” long before the Clinton probe ended. In September, Graham told Fox News that although he does not think Comey perjured himself, he wants Comey to return to testify.\n\n“This doesn’t add up, and I smell a rat here,” Graham said.</p>",

                  "headline": "After Maria, José Andrés and his team have served more meals in Puerto Rico than the Red Cross",
                  "text": "<p>A week ago, President Trump issued a warning on Twitter: He could not keep the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the military and other first responders in Puerto Rico forever, he wrote. His tweet was quickly viewed by some as a threat that the government might abandon its own territory before the island could recover from the devastating blow delivered by Hurricane Maria in mid-September.\n\nOn Tuesday, chef and restaurateur José Andrés said his nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, and the hundreds who have volunteered to help it, would keep feeding Puerto Ricans until the locals could again take care of themselves, which could take awhile. According to FEMA, only 14 percent of the island has electricity, and many areas still have no drinking water or access to fresh food.\n\n“When we establish contact with a community, we maintain that contact,” Andrés said during a phone interview from San Juan. “When we go to a place, we take care of that place until we feel it has the right conditions to sustain itself. That’s what a relief organization should be.”\n\nAndrés landed in Puerto Rico on Sept. 25 and immediately started working with chef José Enrique, whose eponymous San Juan restaurant was already preparing batches of sancocho — a Puerto Rican beef stew — for hungry residents. In their first couple of days together, the chefs produced enough food to feed 1,000 or 2,000 people. Within a week of Andrés’s appearance on the island, their numbers skyrocketed to 25,000 meals per day, now including sandwiches and paella.\n\nNearly a month after Maria, Andrés, World Central Kitchen and volunteers have reached a milestone in their #chefsforpuertorico campaign: As of Tuesday, they’ve prepared and delivered a million meals to residents. As a point of comparison, the American Red Cross has served more than 540,000 meals and snacks (and distributed more than 534,000 relief supplies) in the weeks since hurricanes Irma and Maria struck Puerto Rico, according to a spokeswoman for the organization.\n\nFEMA has provided more than 14 million meals and 11 million liters of water in all 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico, said spokesman Dan Stoneking. That number includes meals provided by state, local and volunteer organizations, such as World Central Kitchen, which FEMA has helped fund. Many of FEMA’s meals are military and civilian MREs, or meals ready to eat, which do not include hot food.\n\nHow Andrés and crew have pulled off this feat is a story that’s difficult to piece together on a cellphone call to Puerto Rico, where service remains spotty and the chef remains too swamped to walk a reporter through all the complex logistics of feeding an island with little gas, electricity or transportation. The chef said it started with Enrique’s restaurant and has now expanded to 15 kitchens, including the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, where the majority of the meals are prepared. Between 450 and 500 volunteers are involved daily.\n\nIn fact, after Andrés navigated Houston’s flooded streets to help feed the city following Hurricane Harvey, he learned an important lesson about relief operations: You need a facility with a large-capacity kitchen to prepare meals on a massive scale; otherwise you’ll never quiet a city’s hunger pains following a disaster. In Houston, Andrés worked at the downtown convention center. But in Puerto Rico, he initially couldn’t get access to the coliseum.\n\n“First, I wanted to come to the coliseo, where I am right now, because I was looking for the biggest kitchen, and they told me, ‘No way, José,'” Andrés recalled, now laughing at the story. A week later, however, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and first lady Beatriz Areizaga helped the chef secure access to the coliseum, where cooks now prepare more than 60,000 meals a day.\n\nWe are launching a #ChefsForPuertoRico kitchen in Vieques with Chef Evita!! @WCKitchen brought two planes full of food to the island! pic.twitter.com/8kR0INLUec — José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) October 16, 2017\n\nAssistance has come from a variety of sources, Andrés said. Donors, large and small, have contributed millions of dollars to World Central Kitchen. Goya Foods loaned WCK its helicopter to fly food into remote regions in the mountains. (The helicopter also helped crews locate a working kitchen, which is now one of the 15 spots for meal preparation.) Even Homeland Security has assisted with food distribution, Andrés said, after the agency helped the chef locate a missing person.\n\n“I became friends with them,” he said of Homeland Security personnel. “We saw that they were going to the very hard-hit areas and that they were going with their cars halfway empty. They said we could bring food, so we began giving them food. They began taking thousands of sandwiches.”\n\nFEMA initially provided money to World Central Kitchen to prepare 20,000 meals. But when the agency tried to negotiate a second contract to prepare another 20,000 meals, Andrés balked. The chef wanted money for 120,000 meals, which exceeded FEMA’s authority to grant without putting the contract out to bid, an agency spokesman said. Regardless, FEMA said it was still looking at another contract with WCK to fund the organization’s meals program.\n\nAndrés then expressed his frustration about government bureaucracy to a Time magazine reporter.\n\n“FEMA used me as a puppet to show that they were doing something,” Andrés told the magazine about the original contract.\n\nJosé Andrés, right, works alongside San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz late last month to prepare a truckload of relief supplies at the Roberto Clemente stadium in San Juan. (Joe Raedle / Getty Images)\n\nSeveral days later, Andrés dialed down his rhetoric, if not his desire to see more from his government. The native Spaniard became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013.\n\n“You know me, nobody holds me back. But at the same time, you have to be strategic,” Andrés said. He understands that FEMA employees have to abide by the rules and the thresholds established by people higher up in the agency. But he would still like to see more flexibility from the agency, particular during times of crisis.\n\n“Bureaucracy needs to give them the tools to move quick and fast to take care of people,” he said. “If bureaucracy doesn’t allow them to move quick and fast, it’s a problem.”\n\nAndrés is not just talking the talk, either. Since he arrived in Puerto Rico, he has put much of his life on hold in Washington, where he oversees ThinkFoodGroup, a company with more than a dozen restaurants, a catering division and a food truck. Andrés was in Puerto Rico, in fact, when he heard the news that Minibar, the chef’s gastronomic funhouse in Penn Quarter, maintained its two Michelin stars.\n\nIn the three-plus weeks since Maria pummeled the island, Andrés has been home only three or four days, he said. He returned once after becoming dehydrated.\n\n“The reality here is very hard to escape. My question is, if we don’t do it, who’s going to do it?” Andrés said about feeding Puerto Ricans. “Fresh food is hard to come by . . . Sometimes the only fresh food people are eating is fruit we are bringing. The only hot meal they are eating is the lukewarm meal we are bringing.”\n\nAndrés hopes that World Central Kitchen is demonstrating what kind of results a nonprofit with a “private sector mentality” can achieve. He suspects that, in years to come, others will be examining “our successes and failures and how we did it.”\n\n“How we were able to go from 100 meals to a million meals,” he added. The secret, Andrés noted, was the chef community, the many volunteers who picked up a knife and got to it. A chef’s disposition, Andrés said, is to know how to adapt to crisis.\n\n“We are survivors,” he said. “We never wanted to be here for so long . . . But circumstances invited us to be part of it.”\n\nThen Andrés remembered a favorite quote from literature, taken from a John Steinbeck novel: “Where there’s a fight so hungry people can eat, I will be there,” he said.\n\nAndrés remembered the quote almost verbatim. It’s a line from Tom Joad, the central character in Steinbeck’s Depression-era novel, “The Grapes of Wrath.” Joad is the one who experiences a major transformation over the course of the story. He, as CliffsNotes reminds us, undergoes a “moral journey from self to community, from ‘I’ to ‘we.’”\n",

                  "text": "<p>Sitting on Mary Maddox’s back porch, which flooded with 22 inches of water when Hurricane Harvey hit nearly two months ago, is a Lady of the Evening plant from Puerto Rico that a friend gave her. Ever since Hurricane Maria ravaged the island, she says, she has paused at the blooming plant when she passes it, rubbing a leaf and saying a prayer for those still without water or electricity.\n\nOften, the prayer is accompanied by frustration with President Trump, whom she voted for and who visited this neighborhood after Harvey.\n\n“He really made me mad,” said Maddox, 70, who accused Trump of trying to pit those on the mainland against Puerto Ricans, even though they’re all Americans.\n\n“I don’t know,” said her husband, Fred Maddox, 75. “I think he’s trying.”\n\nHe continued: “It’s a problem, but they need to handle it. It shouldn’t be up to us, really. I don’t think so. They’re sitting back, they’re taking the money, they’re taking a little under the table. He’s trying to wake them up: Do your job. Be responsible.”\n\nThe divide in the Maddox household is one playing out across the country, as those who voted for the president debate how much support the federal government should give Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory without a voting member of Congress that is not allowed to vote in presidential elections.\n\nSome supporters of the president, like Fred Maddox, agree with Trump that Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was frail before the storm; that the crisis was worsened by a lack of leadership there; and that the federal government should limit its involvement in the rebuilding effort, which will likely cost billions of dollars. But others, like Mary Maddox, are appalled by how the president talks about Puerto Rico and say the United States has a moral obligation to take care of its citizens.\n\nA survey released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority of Americans believe that the federal government has been too slow to respond in Puerto Rico and that the island still isn’t getting the help it needs. But the results largely broke along party lines: While nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the federal government isn’t doing enough, almost three-quarters of Republicans said it is.\n\nIt has been two months since Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Gulf Coast states, and more than a month since Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico.\n\nOn Oct. 3 — two weeks after the storm — Trump toured a neighborhood outside San Juan, Puerto Rico, and has repeatedly proclaimed, against much evidence, that his administration had a “tremendous” response to Maria. He gave his administration a “10” during a White House appearance with Puerto Rico’s governor this week. “I think we did a fantastic job, and we’re being given credit,” he said.\n\nIn fact, conditions remain dire throughout much of the island. Nearly 80 percent of Puerto Ricans still lack electricity, and 30 percent do not have access to clean drinking water.\n\nResidents of San Juan had strong words after President Trump tweeted on Oct. 12 that relief workers would not stay in Puerto Rico “forever.” (Hector Santos Guia,Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n\nHere in the Maddoxes’ neighborhood of Sageglen, by contrast, life is slowly returning to normal. On Sept. 2, just after the storm, Trump briefly toured Sageglen — a middle-class enclave on the southern edge of Houston — and announced in a cul-de-sac piled with Sheetrock debris and trash bags: “These are people that have done a fantastic job holding it together.”\n\nThere’s still a near-constant sound of construction in the heavily Republican neighborhood, which is filled with ranch-style and modest two-story homes. But there are no longer mountains of debris on the curbs, thanks to the local municipal utility district, which shared the cost of removal with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There are brand-new cars sitting in several driveways, thanks to car-insurance companies quickly totaling flooded vehicles and local dealers offering flood deals.\n\nThose in the neighborhood without flood insurance were able to apply for and receive assistance from FEMA — including the Maddoxes, who recently had $14,000 in federal money land in their checking account.\n\nIn the nearly two decades that the Maddoxes have lived in their ranch house on Sagelink Circle, they had seen no need for flood insurance. And, after recently helping one of their daughters pay legal fees for a divorce, the couple’s savings isn’t what it once was.\n\n“I’m very appreciative to FEMA. I really, really am,” said Mary Maddox, who has been married for more than 50 years and raised five children. “I was just so excited when I saw that they loved us.”\n\n‘They don’t live deprived’\n\nOn a recent afternoon on nearby Sagelink Court, David Hogg stopped by the driveway of his neighbor Donna Ramirez, showing her the latest handful of screws he had collected from the cul-de-sac.\n\nHogg and his wife, Patsy Hogg, have had flood insurance for decades after watching water come dangerously close to flooding the first floor of their two-story home soon after they moved to the neighborhood in the late 1970s. They now pay about $450 per year.\n\nRamirez and her husband also said they thought that they had flood insurance on their home, which they bought a year ago, only to learn weeks after the storm that they did not.\n\nTo Ramirez, the role of the government is to broadly coordinate relief efforts and ensure that insurance companies are fulfilling their obligations to policyholders — but that people should take personal responsibility for their property or look to churches or charities for assistance.\n\n“Do other people think that other people should pay for me to fix my house? Because it’s not their fault that I flooded,” said Ramirez, taking a break from sorting through soggy research documents in her garage.\n\nRamirez, who describes herself a “throw-the-dice-type voter,” said she reluctantly voted for Trump in November — although her support deepened after meeting Trump in her cul-de-sac about a month ago.\n\n“In person, he’s totally different than on TV, and he gave us just such a feeling of confidence, like we weren’t forgotten about,” said Ramirez, who has one grown daughter. “He talked directly at a lot of people in the crowd, and his word for me was: ‘Don’t lose hope, you’re going to be all right.’”\n\nRamirez worries that when the government makes money easily available after a natural disaster, there’s an opportunity for corruption and a chance that some people will take more than they need. And she thinks that media coverage of the crisis in Puerto Rico has lacked context, especially in reporting that nearly all of the island is still without electricity.\n\n“Guess what? There’s a big chunk of the population that lives without electricity all the time,” Ramirez said, saying he was sharing the experiences of a friend who has family on the island.\n\nHogg, 76, nodded his head in agreement: “They never had it. Never had it.”\n\n“They don’t live deprived because it’s a beautiful environment,” she continued. “The weather is nice, the climate is good, most of the time, so it’s different from here . . . It works there because of the climate. It wouldn’t work here.”\n\nAbout 96 percent of Puerto Rico electricity customers had service before Maria made landfall, according to federal data; many of the rest had no power because of Hurricane Irma two weeks earlier.\n\nRamirez said the government should encourage those living in the hardest-hit areas to move to the mainland, out of the direct path of hurricanes and into communities with more reliable infrastructure.\n\n“I object. I object. They should stay where they are and fix their own country up,” Hogg responded softly, shaking his head, wrongly referring to the U.S. territory as a separate nation.\n\nAfter exhausting their stay in a shelter, this Houston family tries to return to normalcy, even while living in their garage. (Ashleigh Joplin,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\n‘No mercy’\n\nLater in the day, as Hogg and his wife sat in their garage workshop, they again debated where the government’s role starts and ends. Patsy Hogg said she’s trying to figure out where exactly she stands — she’s worried about the ever-growing national debt, but she can’t stand to see people suffer.\n\nBoth are longtime Republicans, although lately they consider themselves first and foremost “Trumpsters.” Patsy Hogg described meeting the president and his wife, who gave her a hug, as a blessing from God.\n\n“We love Trump,” she said. “We voted for him. We pray for him every day.”\n\nThe couple agrees that the president needs to be more careful with what he says on Twitter, especially when it comes to Puerto Rico.\n\nBut David Hogg, a retired electrical engineer who once worked at NASA, also said that Puerto Ricans’ “lack of responsibility is not an emergency on my part.” The same goes for Texans without flood insurance, he said.\n\n[Desperate Puerto Ricans line up for water — at a hazardous-waste site]\n\nHis wife frowned, stared at him and asked: “So you have no mercy?”\n\n“Uh uh. No mercy,” he said. “They should do what I do: Spend the money, get insurance.”\n\nPatsy Hogg said one of their friends at their Baptist church, a retired single woman, didn’t have flood insurance when her two-story townhouse flooded and FEMA quickly provided her with some money.\n\n“I was glad that they did that. That made me feel good,” Patsy Hogg said. “She’s certainly not destitute, but I’m just really glad that they did that. If that’s my tax dollar at work, I’m okay with that.”\n\nShe then came to her husband’s defense: “And he’s not really as hardhearted as he sounds. He was very glad when he learned that they had given her money.”\n\nThe Maddoxes, who live in the next cul-de-sac over from the Hoggs, were away from home when Trump visited and struggled to get back into the neighborhood until after his motorcade had left.\n\nThe couple, both “cradle Catholics” and longtime Republicans, cannot remember a time when they disagreed about politics like they do now. Mary Maddox has hit the point where she believes Trump needs to be impeached and replaced with someone who will unite and heal the country.\n\n“I get so disgusted,” she said, sitting at her dining room table. “He is like a 13-year-old girl, tweeting and everything. I just want him to act his age, and be nice to people and bring the country together. I voted for the man but I’m just — I want our country to be friendly. “\n\nFred Maddox, who is retired from inspecting commercial airline planes, says he doesn’t agree with many of the things Trump flippantly says, but he still believes in the president and would vote for him again. He likes having a businessman in office, especially one who’s not afraid to speak the painful truth — even if that means publicly calling out Puerto Rican officials during a crisis.\n\n“It’s time,” he said, “we had someone in there to fight for us.”\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.</p>",

There’s also a $16 billion increase in the National Flood Insurance Program’s borrowing limit; $576.5 million to address wildfires in the West; and $1.2 billion for nutrition assistance programs that will provide low-income Puerto Rican residents relief after Hurricane Maria slammed the island.\n\nRelief for Puerto Rico dominated the latest round of emergency funding, with more than 80 percent of the island still without power more than a month after the storm and growing concerns that a failure to restore power and provide basic services to residents could cause a mass exodus to the mainland United States.\n\nThe bill now goes to President Trump for his signature.\n\nWhite House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney listens as President Trump and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello meet in the Oval Office on Oct. 19, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSeveral senators in both parties slowed consideration of the legislation in recent days, saying they expected more relief for their states or significant reforms to the flood insurance program and other shipping and labor laws before final approval. None of those concerns derailed the bill and the White House has assured lawmakers they will address their concerns in the next round of emergency funding they expect to request next month.\n\nSens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) are clamoring for money to help Florida’s distressed citrus industry after Hurricane Irma battered the state. The state’s agricultural industry sustained more than $2.5 billion in damages, including more than $760 million for the citrus industry alone, according to Nelson’s office.\n\n“It’s not an industry that benefits from anything extraordinary from the government. They literally are on the verge of going away unless we help them sooner rather than later,” Rubio warned on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Sens. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) were pushing for more money to help communities upended by Hurricane Harvey, and they threatened to hold up Tuesday’s vote. But last week, they relented when given assurances by the Trump administration that Texas’s concerns would be better addressed in the next funding request. Despite those assurances, Cornyn is blocking a vote to confirm the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget as leverage.\n\n“Promises were made from OMB to fully support Texans as they continue to recover from Hurricane Harvey, and he’s going to make sure those promises are kept,” a Cornyn spokeswoman said.\n\nA handful of Republicans withheld their support because the bill does not offset the emergency spending with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget or because the bill failed to revamp the NFIP — a longtime pursuit of conservatives.\n\n“Instead of helping the victims of these disasters through responsible aid paired with lasting reform, Congress has rushed to its favorite solution: Billions in new spending, with little accountability or oversight,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said in a Senate floor speech Monday evening as he announced his opposition.\n\nHomes and infrastructure lie in ruins outside the city of Caguas, Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), voted against the measure because it failed to lift Jones Act requirements that any ship carrying relief supplies to Puerto Rico be American built, owned, flagged and crewed.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, while supporting the legislation, used the vote as an opportunity to knock Trump’s recent proclamations that his administration is perfectly handling storm relief missions, especially in Puerto Rico.\n\n“The Administration was slow to respond to the disaster, and to claim that they get a ‘10 out of 10’ for their response is to ignore the facts,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Monday as debate continued on the legislation. “This is not a reality TV show where the participant with the highest score advances to the next round. These are people’s lives. These are people’s homes. This is the hard part of governing. This is where we roll up our sleeves and dig in for the long haul.”\n</p>",

                  "headline": "Trump administration disavows Puerto Rico power contract",
                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration scrambled Friday to distance itself from the decision to award a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico's power grid to a tiny Montana company from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown.\n\nThe White House said federal officials played no role in the selection of Whitefish Energy Holdings by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.\n\nThe administration disavowed the contract amid a growing number of investigations and a bipartisan chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Zinke had given the president his personal assurance that he had nothing to do with what she described as \"a state and local decision made by the Puerto Rican authorities and not the federal government.\"\n\nThe interior secretary also issued a fiery denial on Twitter, saying \"Only in elitist Washington, D.C., would being from a small town be considered a crime.\"\n\nWhitefish Energy Holdings is headquartered in Whitefish, Montana, which has a population of about 7,200. Zinke, a former Montana congressman, knows Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski. Zinke's son also had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site.\n\n\"I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico,\" said Zinke in a statement linked to a tweet. \"Any attempts by the dishonest media or political operatives to tie me to awarding or influencing any contract involving Whitefish are completely baseless.\"\n\nZinke acknowledged that after the company's initial contract was awarded, he was contacted by the company, though he did not give the name of the individual who reached out to him. Zinke said he took no action and that all relevant documents would be disclosed to \"appropriate officials.\"\n\n\"I welcome any and all investigations into these allegations,\" Zinke said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, an agency watchdog, confirmed Friday that federal auditors will review the Whitefish contract.\n\n\"As part of their standard procedure, they will conduct vetting to look for the presence of any inappropriate relationships,\" said Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of Homeland Security, said it has not approved any reimbursement requests from the utility for money to cover ongoing repairs to the island's power grid following Hurricane Maria.\n\nFEMA said in a statement that any language in the controversial contract saying the agency approved of the deal with Whitefish is inaccurate. The contract said the utility would not pay costs unallowable under FEMA grants, but it also said, \"The federal government is not a party to this contract.\"\n\nThe agency said its initial review raised significant concerns about how Whitefish got the deal and whether the contracted prices were reasonable. The 2-year-old company had just two full-time employees when the storm hit Sept. 20. It has since hired more than 300 workers.\n\nA price list attached to the Whitefish contract reviewed by The Associated Press sets rates for both workers and equipment to be paid by the utility: $20,277 an hour for a heavy lift Chinook helicopter, $650 an hour for a large crane truck, $322 an hour for a foreman of a power line crew, $319 an hour for a journeyman lineman and $286 an hour for a mechanic. Each worker also gets a daily allowance of $80 for food, $332 for a hotel room and $1,000 for each flight to or from the mainland.\n\nMultiple congressional committees have opened investigations into the deal, the terms of which have triggered questions from both Republicans and Democrats. Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, senior Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the Whitefish contract \"raises every red flag in the book.\"\n\nDemocrats also raised questions about the role of HBC Investments, a key financial backer of Whitefish Energy. The Dallas-based company's founder and general partner, Joe Colonnetta, has contributed thousands of dollars to Trump and other Republicans, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, and Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Colonnetta also gave to Trump's inauguration.\n\nA Whitefish spokesman called Colonnetta's political donations \"irrelevant.\" ''If one of the investors supported President Trump, that has nothing to do with anything,\" spokesman Chris Chiames said.\n\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority director Ricardo Ramos has praised the work performed by Whitefish so far, saying the company's was the only offer the utility received that did not require a down payment. The power company is $9 billion in debt and was already struggling to provide service amid ongoing power outages before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit last month.\n\n\"There is nothing illegal going on here,\" Ramos said Thursday.\n\nA federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances said this week it had appointed a former military officer to oversee the work. Retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot will be responsible for speeding up reconstruction efforts and overseeing coordination with the board, Puerto Rico's government and the federal government.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Zamot would have the authority to void Whitefish's contract, although under the contract the utility can suspend or terminate the contract \"for any or no reason\" after providing written notice to Whitefish and compensating the company for actual expenses.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the U.S. territory remains without power more than a month after the Category 4 storm made landfall.\n\nPuerto Rico Public Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario told reporters on Friday he wasn't familiar with the contract's details when asked why it includes a clause that prohibits an audit or review of \"the cost and profit elements of the labor rates.\"\n\nRosario said only that Puerto Rico's governor already has requested an audit and that the government will turn over all pertinent documents.\n\n\"There obviously needs to be transparency,\" Rosario said. \"If anyone did anything illegal, let them fry in jail.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Ben Fox in Miami and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck</p>",

                  "text": "<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a decision by Puerto Rico’s power authority to award a $300 million contract to a tiny Montana energy firm to rebuild electrical infrastructure damaged in Hurricane Maria, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAgents from the FBI’s San Juan field office are looking into circumstances surrounding the deal that the public power monopoly known as Prepa signed with Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC, according to the people familiar with the matter.\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló canceled the contract Sunday, saying it had become a distraction from the U.S. territory’s efforts to restore the devastated grid. Only 30% of the island’s power customers have had electricity restored.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, multiple congressional committees and local auditors also have raised concerns and begun requesting documents about the deal.\n\n“Whitefish is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or investigation,” a company spokesman said Monday. “The procurement of the PREPA contract was at all times fully appropriate.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Gov. Rosselló said he “welcomes any investigation by the federal authorities and he has been clear: there should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”\n\nA spokesman for the FBI field office couldn’t be reached.\n\nThe House Committee on Natural Resources said Monday it would hold hearings over the next three weeks on the storm recovery and on transparency in the reconstruction process.\n\nRicardo Ramos, executive director of Prepa, had defended the Whitefish pick and said the contracting process was done according to the utility’s regulations for handling emergency situations.\n\nWhitefish, a startup firm based in the remote hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, had roughly 350 subcontracted workers and 2,500 tons of heavy equipment on the ground for restoring electrical lines destroyed in the Category-4 hurricane. But the firm’s small size and limited track record, as well as the terms of the contract, ignited concerns around Puerto Rico’s management of the flow of federal disaster-relief dollars to the island.\n\nMr. Zinke, an acquaintance of Whitefish Chief Executive Andy Techmanski, issued a statement last week denying he had any involvement in the company securing the deal.\n\nOn Friday, FEMA said it had questions about how Whitefish’s prices were negotiated and was working with Prepa and its legal advisers to determine how the contract was procured as well as how the utility determined the prices.\nThe Whitefish controversy now threatens to cost Puerto Rico’s governor control of the power utility, which this summer entered a court-supervised bankruptcy proceeding. He is vying for control of Prepa with the federal oversight board installed by Congress to supervise Puerto Rico’s economic planning. The oversight board last week took steps last week to install a retired Air Force colonel as a “chief transformation officer” to take over Prepa’s operations.\n\nThe governor said he would oppose the change and that management of public corporations such as Prepa should rest exclusively with local officials appointed under Puerto Rican law. The judge overseeing the bankruptcy process is expected to decide who should be in charge.\n\nA committee representing Puerto Rico creditors petitioned the court Monday to take depositions and obtain documents surrounding the “questionable nature” of the Whitefish deal.\n\nThe Whitefish contract had terms that precluded government agencies from auditing certain profit and cost elements and provided compensation for linemen that critics on the island said were in excess of typical rates, even considering the rugged working conditions in remote regions of Puerto Rico.\nWhitefish has defended its work and said that without its quick arrival to the island, utility crews would only now be getting there to begin restoration work.\n\nMr. Rosselló said Sunday he would reactivate mutual aid agreements with utilities from Florida and New York that Prepa initially chose not to tap after the storm in favor of private contractors.\nA Whitefish spokesman said Sunday it was “very disappointed” by the governor’s decision to shred the contract, arguing that bringing in replacement brigades would only delay restoring power to the majority of Prepa customers who still lack service.\n\nFEMA said Friday it hadn’t confirmed whether it considered Whitefish’s prices to be reasonable and hadn’t yet provided any reimbursement for the contract. FEMA said it hadn’t authorized Whitefish’s payment terms, despite language in the contract stating the terms had been approved for reimbursement by the agency.\nMr. Ramos told The Wall Street Journal the language should have been removed from the contract but was left in by mistake.\n\n“That’s civil fraud without any doubt,” said John Mudd, a Puerto Rico-based attorney who represents government contractors in court proceedings. “If the contract is canceled and these people are not paid,” he said. “They can claim that they were defrauded.”\n\nPrepa based its decision on the contract rates, the time it would take for crews to mobilize and the fact that Whitefish didn’t require a large upfront payment, Mr. Ramos said. He said that to his knowledge there was no outside influence on his procurement department and that Prepa structured the deal so money would be released in tranches of between $1 million and $3 million as work was completed.\n\nBut Mr. Ramos also acknowledged that the contracting process was rushed due to the emergency circumstances and that Prepa didn’t receive certain protections, including a performance bond.\nIf FEMA determines the contract to be non-reimbursable for failing to comply with agency requirements, Prepa could be stuck with the bill for a month’s worth of work by Whitefish, Mr. Mudd said.\nThe controversy “certainly will chill some people’s opinions” about doing business with Puerto Rico or investing capital on the island, said Tom Lewis, president of U.S. operations at Louis Berger Group, an engineering firm involved in the hurricane recovery. “Credibility matters, not just to Washington D.C. but also to the private sector, which will have to play a role.”\n\nWhitefish signed a deal framework on Sept. 26, less than a week after Maria made landfall. It was amended on Oct. 17, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.\n\nIn an Oct. 21 letter seeking assistance from Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Mr. Rossello said that “restoring electricity to our citizens has become a daunting task, mainly because of the lack of liquidity of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.”\nMr. Scott, a Republican, said Monday he will lead a delegation of the state’s utility providers to the island Friday.\n\nWrite to Andrew Scurria at andrew.Scurria@wsj.com\nAppeared in the October 31, 2017, print edition as 'FBI Probes Puerto Rico Power-Grid Deal.'\n\n\n</p>",

USA TODAY\n\nAngel Luis Vazquez with his wife, Marta Colón de Jesús, and daughter, Coral, in front of their home, which was severely damaged by Hurricane Maria.

Maria, which landed here Sept. 20, was the most devastating storm to hit the island in 70 years, killing more than 50 people, displacing thousands and upending the lives of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million inhabitants.\n\nChildren who experience destructive storms are often the most vulnerable to long-term mental health effects, said Irwin Redlener, head of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and president of the Children’s Health Fund.\n\nA study Redlener led after Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf found that one-third of children in that disaster reported to have at least one mental health problem, but fewer than half of their parents were able to access professional services. Children post-Katrina were also 4-1/2 times more likely to have serious emotional disturbances than those not affected by the disaster, the study showed.\n\nSebastian Irlanda, Esteban Irlanda, Alex Gonzalez and Valeria Gonzalez pose for a picture in the courtyard of Colegio San Juan Bautista in Orocovis, Puerto Rico. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY)\n\nMaria may spur even more issues, since the storm affected virtually the entire island and many family members have been so busy securing basic needs, such as food and water, that children’s needs may be overlooked, Redlener said. Most schools have been closed since the hurricane hit six weeks ago, though more are expected to reopen this week, returning some normalcy to youngsters’ lives.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and local groups such as the Ponce Health Sciences University have deployed some mental health services to impacted areas, though much more is likely needed, Redlener said.\n\n“There’s going to be a mismatch of resources and need,” he said. “It’s really important that people go in and help families manage and deal with this massive trauma that has occurred.”\n\nIn Orocovis, with federal aid slow to reach the remote mountain town, local educators accepted an offer from Connecticut-based Save the Children to launch a temporary child care facility in a shuttered Catholic school. About 154 children ages 4 to 15 signed up and spent each morning, from 8 a.m. to noon, the past two weeks surrounded by teachers, social workers and other students, said Eugenio Soto, an educator and program coordinator.\n\nThe students at first were withdrawn and kept to themselves, he said. “It’s like they had something inside and they didn’t want anyone to know about it,” Soto said.\n\nSlowly, through programs designed to verbalize thoughts, the students began sharing their experiences: How their house lost a roof or their family was displaced, he said. One student was upset that school supplies had blown away in the storm. They began talking more. “They could see that we were all going through the same thing, but it hasn’t been the end of the world,” Soto said.\n\nMore: Puerto Rico's water woes raise fears of health crisis six weeks after Hurricane Maria\n\nMore: Puerto Rico power restoration: Why it is taking so long\n\nMore: San Juan mayor blasts President Trump over recovery efforts in Puerto Rico\n\nValeria Gonzalez, a buoyant, smiling 8-year-old, said she misses school and enjoys playing with her friends in the temporary school’s big concrete patio. During Maria, Valeria and her family gathered at her grandmother’s house to ride out the storm. But when that home started to flood, the family rushed to her aunt’s house in the middle of the hurricane.\n\n“We had to go fast because the hurricane was blowing hard and raining,” she said. “When we entered the house, we turned on the generator and they made us hot chocolate.” The next day, the family peeked outside to see devastation everywhere, including a relative’s home that was completely destroyed except for the bathroom.\n\n“Everyone was shocked,” Valeria said. “It was terrible.”\n\nAbout 20 minutes farther up the mountain from the school, Angel Luis Vazquez, 46, rode out the storm in his small, two-story home with wife Marta, daughter Coral and his father-in-law, Teodoro Colón Rodriguez, 82, who was recovering from a stroke and bedridden.\n\nThe storm mauled through the home's second story, tearing off most of the roof and splintering walls as the family huddled in the ground floor. Rodriguez died during the storm, and it took three days for local authorities to reach the home and remove the body. Coral seemed most affected by the ordeal, Vazquez said.\n\nA child's toy hangs from one of the ruined walls of the Vazquez family home, which was damaged by Hurricane Maria in Orocovis.

I was worried about the wind, making sure no more water got in the house, defending us as best I could. It wasn’t easy.”\n\nSince the storm, Marta’s blood pressure has shot up and Vazquez said he’s worried how his daughter is handling everything, since she was close to her grandfather. They could use outside help, he said.\n\n“We need people to check on us, to see how we’re doing emotionally,” Vazquez said. “Because we’re not well.”\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hHf19G</p>",

REUTERS/Aaron P.

Pai now plans to hold a final vote on the proposal at the FCC’s Dec. 14 meeting, the people said, and roll out details of the plans next week.\n\nPai asked in May for public comment on whether the FCC has authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “fast lanes” to some websites, known as “paid prioritization.” Several industry officials told Reuters they expect Pai to drop those specific legal requirements but retain some transparency requirements under the order.\n\nAn FCC spokesman declined to comment.\n\nInternet providers including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc say ending the rules could spark billions in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility a future administration could regulate internet pricing.\n\nCritics say the move could harm consumers, small businesses and access to the internet.\n\nIn July, a group representing major technology firms including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc urged Pai to drop plans to rescind the rules.\n\nAdvocacy group Free Press said Wednesday “we’ll learn the gory details in the next few days, but we know that Pai intends to dismantle the basic protections that have fueled the internet’s growth.”\n\nPai, who argues the Obama order was unnecessary and harms jobs and investment, has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” The proposal to reverse the Obama rules reclassifying internet service has drawn more than 22 million comments.\n\nPai is mounting an aggressive deregulatory agenda since being named by President Donald Trump to head the FCC.\n\nOn Thursday the FCC will vote on Pai’s proposal to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. The proposal would make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market.\n\nPai is also expected to call for an initial vote in December to rescind rules that say one company may not own stations serving more than 39 percent of U.S. television households, two people briefed on the matter said.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>The Federal Communications Commission voted May 18 to begin undoing Obama-era Internet regulations that disallowed Internet providers from favoring or blocking websites. Here's what's next for the commission and your Internet. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n\nWith its final meeting of the year less than a month away, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to reveal the latest details of a plan to roll back the government's net neutrality regulations this week. The result could reshape the entire digital ecosystem by giving Internet providers more control over what their customers can see and access online and how quickly they can do it.\n\nUnder current rules, broadband companies such as Verizon and Comcast must treat all websites and online services equally. Verizon, for instance, isn't allowed to deliver content from Yahoo, which it owns, to consumers any faster than it delivers competing content from Google. It also isn't permitted to actively slow down or block Google services.\n\nBut the FCC is likely to change all that, analysts say, relaxing the Obama-era rules that required providers to behave like legacy telecom companies who must carry all phone calls on a nondiscriminatory basis. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai “will try to shrink the footprint of the rules,” said Daniel Berninger, a telecom engineer who has opposed the regulations. The FCC declined to comment.\n\nThe FCC typically releases the agenda for its monthly open meetings three weeks in advance, giving the public a look at the items the agency is expected to consider. Under Pai, a critic of the current net neutrality rules, the regulatory body has also released the full texts of its proposed resolutions ahead of its meetings.\n\nThe FCC's deregulatory push\n\nIn earlier drafts of the net neutrality proposal, Pai has asked whether the agency should be involved in regulating Internet providers at all. “We … propose to relinquish any authority over Internet traffic exchange,” read the FCC's initial proposal, which was released in May.\n\nPai, a Republican, has argued that the regulations discourage Internet providers from investing in upgrades to their infrastructure and that the rules are an example of government overreach.\n\nBut supporters of the rules say they are a necessary consumer protection as Internet providers such as Comcast, Verizon and AT&T have sought to control a growing chunk of the country's media and information economies. Since 2010, the three firms have explored or completed purchases of major media entities, such as NBC Universal, Yahoo and Time Warner, respectively.\n\nNet neutrality rules “recognize the importance of maintaining a level playing field for all Internet content — regardless of the creator or owner — to be enjoyed by all users, regardless of their Internet provider,” wrote the mayors of 65 cities in a recent letter to Pai.\n\nThis week's anticipated update to Pai's proposal comes after months of public debate, including a controversy this summer over fraudulent comments filed in the agency's docket by automated systems that, according to critics, threatened to skew the policymaking process. Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic FCC commissioner, said the bot-driven filings were cause for several public hearings on the matter before any net neutrality vote.\n\n“We must have direct public input before we consider any net neutrality policy that will have a direct impact on our families, our communities, and our economy,” Rosenworcel said Monday in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nWhat the rollback could mean for future regulation\n\nMany of the specifics of Pai's plan remain unclear, but a central part of the effort will involve undoing the FCC's decision to declare Internet providers as telecommunications service providers. The legal designation allowed the FCC to more strictly regulate broadband firms than when the companies were known merely as providers of an “information service.”\n\nPai's deregulatory proposal will probably reverse this decision, according to analysts, setting off a chain of consequences for the industry and how it is regulated. If the move is approved — and it probably will be, given that Republicans control three of the FCC's five seats — responsibility for regulating Internet providers could flow away from the FCC and toward the Federal Trade Commission, which is charged with protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices.\n\nSome consumer groups fear that leaving net neutrality to the FTC could weaken enforcement, as the FTC's power in that area may be limited to policing truth in advertising and other commitments that Internet providers make to the public.\n\n“The FTC is not equipped, and lacks jurisdiction, to resolve issues with Internet service providers,” the National Hispanic Media Coalition wrote in a regulatory filing last summer.\n\nThe FCC proposal does not require President Trump’s signature, but Trump criticized the net neutrality regulations during his campaign as a “top-down power grab” by the government. Republican lawmakers have also criticized the FCC rules supporting net neutrality, with some, such as Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), calling for congressional legislation to supersede the regulations.\n\nCreating political pressure on Democrats to negotiate a legislative compromise is a key aspect of Pai's proposal, according to people familiar with the FCC’s thinking. Thus far, Democrats have resisted discussing any net neutrality legislation that could replace the current FCC rules. But with the agency poised to weaken the regulations substantially, Republicans at the FCC hope to create a policy vacuum that could bring Democrats to the bargaining table in Congress, the people said.</p>",

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\nFCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on rescinding the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities.\n\nWith three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama.\n\n“The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet.\n\n“We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added.\n\nThe net neutrality rules, aimed at giving consumers equal access to web content, also forbade broadband providers from charging consumers more for certain content, a practice called “paid prioritization.”\n\nPai said state and local governments “need to be preempted” from imposing their own net neutrality rules because broadband internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content.\n\nThe FCC’s planned action represents a victory for internet service providers including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, which had urged the FCC to revoke the rules. The companies have said that repealing the could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing.\n\nIn July, a group representing major technology firms including Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai to drop plans to rescind the rules.\n\nAt the December meeting, the FCC will vote on Pai’s proposal to require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate paid prioritization. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26, 2015. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nThe FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies.\n\nA federal appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by a telecommunications industry trade association.\n\n‘GONE FOR GOOD’\n\nThe FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Many Democrats and some internet firms argue that without the rules, internet providers will threaten the openness of the internet.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter, “The internet is the public square of the 21st century. Unless we all speak out against the @FCC’s efforts to gut #netneutrality, the free and open internet we know today could be gone for good.”\n\nThe planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law.\n\nThe new order will reclassify internet providers as “information services” rather than a “telecommunication service,” which means the FCC has significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct.\n\nPai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since taking over as chairman, is mounting a broad deregulatory agenda and has pledged to take a “weed whacker” to unneeded regulations. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo the order by White House officials.\n\nPai said the FCC is adopting a “market-based deregulatory approach.” The FCC also will vote to eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gives the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit any internet service provider practice that it believes violates a long list of factors and sought to address future discriminatory conduct.\n\nPai said his goal is to use a “light-touch market-based” regulatory approach, arguing the internet operated well before the rules were adopted in 2015. The internet “is the greatest free market innovation in history,” Pai said, adding that government regulations could hinder that.</p>",

The agency’s Republican chairman, Ajit Pai, has made undoing the government's net neutrality rules one of his top priorities, and Tuesday's move hands a win to broadband companies such as AT&T, Verizon and Comcast.\n\nPai is taking aim at regulations that were approved just two years ago under a Democratic presidency and that sought to make sure all Internet content, whether from big or small companies, would be treated equally by Internet providers.\n\nThe decision will be put to a vote at the agency's Dec. 14 meeting in Washington. It is expected to pass, with the GOP controlling three of the commission's five seats.\n\nIn a release, Pai said his proposal would prevent the government from \"micromanaging the Internet.\" In place of the existing rules, he added, the FCC would \"simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices.\"\n\nOn December 14, the FCC will vote on Chairman Pai's plan to repeal President Obama's heavy-handed Internet regulations and restore Internet freedom. — Matthew Berry (@matthewberryfcc) November 21, 2017\n\nThe proposal would also shift some enforcement responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission, which can sue companies for violating the commitments or statements they have made to the public. Relying more heavily on Internet providers' own promises on net neutrality reflects a departure from the current rules, which lay out clear federal bans against the selective blocking or slowing of websites, as well as the speeding-up of websites that agree to pay the providers a fee.\n\nInternet providers welcomed the FCC announcement.\n\n\"We’re very encouraged by Chairman Pai’s announcement today that the FCC will move forward next month to restore the successful light-touch regulatory framework for internet services,\" Verizon said in a statement.\n\nBut the FCC proposal is largely opposed by Internet companies such as Google, which said Tuesday that the rules help protect an open Internet.\n\n\"The FCC’s net neutrality rules are working well for consumers and we’re disappointed in the proposal released today,\" said Google in a statement.\n\nFormer Democratic FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, who drafted the 2015 net neutrality rules and rammed them through in spite of Republican opposition, called Tuesday's move \"tragic.\"\n\n\"The job of the FCC is to represent the consumer,\" he said in an interview. \"If you like your cable company, you'll love what this does for the Internet, because it gives Internet service providers the same kind of control over content and price as cable operators have today.\"\n\nStory developing…</p>",

                  "text": "<p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman released an open letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, accusing the agency of stonewalling his office's investigation into what he called a \"massive scheme\" to inundate the FCC's public net neutrality review process with fake comments.\n\n\"The process the FCC has employed to consider potentially sweeping alterations to current net neutrality rules has been corrupted by the fraudulent use of Americans’ identities and the FCC has been unwilling to assist my office in our efforts to investigate this unlawful activity,\" Schneiderman wrote to Pai, a Republican appointed to head the agency by President Donald Trump.\n\nNet neutrality rules prevent internet service providers like AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and others from charging more to access certain websites. The rules were established to provide an equal playing field online.\n\nUnder Democratic leadership, the FCC approved net neutrality rules in 2015, but the agency is now controlled by Republican appointees and has taken a different stance under the Trump administration. Pai rolled out the FCC's plan to scrap the Obama-era rules ahead of a vote scheduled to take place on Dec. 14.\n\nThe process allows the public to comment on the changes and weigh in on the issue before the agency makes its final decision.\n\n\"Enormous numbers of fake comments concerning the possible repeal of net neutrality rules\" were first reported in May of this year, Schneiderman's letter said.\n\nThe false comments attempted \"to drown out and negate the views of the real people, businesses, and others who honestly commented on this important issue,\" according to Schneiderman's letter.\n\nAn FCC spokesperson told ABC News Schneiderman's \"so-called investigation is nothing more than a transparent attempt by a partisan supporter of the Obama Administration's heavy-handed Internet regulations to gain publicity for himself.\"\n\n“The potential impersonation of hundreds of thousands of Americans in order to influence the policy-making process should concern everyone—especially the FCC,\" Schneiderman's office responded. \"Yet rather than cooperate with our investigation, the Commission has stonewalled it, and now offers political attacks to distract from the core issue—the manipulation of the FCC’s own regulatory process.”\n\nIn his letter, Schneiderman writes that he has \"long publicly advocated for strong net neutrality rules,\" but said his investigation is about \"the right to control one’s own identity and prevent the corruption of a process designed to solicit the opinion of real people and institutions.\"\n\nThe FCC said it would base its decision on facts and legal arguments, not on repetitive form letters that surface in the commenting process, the spokesperson said. The agency received some 7.5 million comments consisting of the same form letter and it also received over 400,000 comments from the same address in Russia in support of the Obama-era rule, according to the spokesperson.\n\nMany of the fake comments \"misused the real names and addresses of actual people as part of the effort to undermine the integrity of the comment process,\" the letter continued, noting that \"hundreds of thousands of Americans likely were victimized in the same way.\"\n\nSchneiderman said the false use of names and addresses amounts to a crime \"akin to identity theft, and it happened on a massive scale.\" The FCC, Schneiderman wrote, \"has refused to provide ... information that is critical to the investigation.\"</p>",

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — After Hurricane Maria damaged tens of thousands of homes in Puerto Rico, a newly created Florida company with an unproven record won more than $30 million in contracts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide emergency tarps and plastic sheeting for repairs.\n\nBronze Star LLC never delivered those urgently needed supplies, which even months later remain in demand by hurricane victims on the island.\n\nFEMA eventually terminated the contracts, without paying any money, and re-started the process this month to supply more tarps for the island. The earlier effort took nearly four weeks from the day FEMA awarded the contracts to Bronze Star and the day it canceled them.\n\nThousands of Puerto Ricans remain homeless, and many complain that the federal government is taking too long to install tarps. The U.S. territory has been hit by severe rainstorms in recent weeks that have caused widespread flooding.\n\nIt is not clear how thoroughly FEMA investigated Bronze Star or its ability to fulfill the contracts. Formed by two brothers in August, Bronze Star had never before won a government contract or delivered tarps or plastic sheeting. The address listed for the business is a single-family home in a residential subdivision in St. Cloud, Florida.\n\nOne of the brothers, Kayon Jones, said manufacturers he contacted before bidding on the contracts assured him they could provide the tarps but later said they could not meet the government's requirements. Jones said supplying the materials was problematic because most of the raw materials came out of Houston, which was hit hard by Hurricane Harvey. He said he sought a waiver from FEMA to allow him to order tarps from a Chinese manufacturer and for more time, but FEMA denied the request.\n\nFEMA canceled the contracts Nov. 6, Jones said. The government notified his brother and him a few days later that it would seek $9.3 million in damages unless they signed a waiver releasing the U.S. from any liability. The brothers agreed.\n\n\"We were trying to help; it wasn't about making money or anything like that,\" Jones said.\n\nFEMA awarded the company two contracts Oct. 10 to provide 500,000 tarps and 60,000 rolls of plastic sheeting. More than a half dozen others also bid, but FEMA said it could not provide details about their bids.\n\n\"The award of a government contract to a company with absolutely no experience in producing the materials sought obviously raises very bright red flags,\" said Dan Feldman, professor of public management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York. \"I would hope and assume that the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security would begin immediately to take a very hard look at this process.\"\n\nA FEMA spokesman, Ron Roth, said the agency's review process was \"somewhat expedited\" after Hurricane Maria to respond as quickly as possible to the emergency. But he said the agency did perform its due diligence.\n\n\"Submissions from potential contractors are objectively evaluated, and a contract is awarded based on the highest-rated submission,\" Roth said.\n\nSuch \"best value\" competitive solicitations take into account past performance and a contractor's ability to deliver as well as price, said Alan Miller, an attorney who spent 22-years advising federal contracting officials until retiring last year.\n\n\"In every circumstance, regardless of the award, whether it's $400 to the local stationery company for envelopes, or it's $400 million for a construction contract, the contracting officer is required to make a responsibility determination,\" Miller said. \"Does this company have the infrastructure; do they have the inventory processes, the production processes, the financial capability, for performing the work?\"\n\nNine bids were received on the first contract for plastic sheeting and eight bids on the second contract for tarps. Roth said Star was determined to be the most qualified.\n\n\"FEMA's initial technical evaluation determined Bronze Star could do the jobs based on their proposals, which confirmed that they could meet the product specifications and delivery dates,\" he said.\n\nKayon Jones, the co-owner of Bronze Star, served in the U.S. Navy from 1997 to 2000, finishing his duty as a seaman storekeeper on the USS Gettysburg, a guided missile cruiser. The contract solicitation gave preference to veteran-owned companies. According to Navy records, Jones was never awarded a Bronze Star, a medal earned by service members who serve heroically in combat.\n\nIn an interview, Jones told The Associated Press he picked the name because he has another company with the word star in it. He said his brother, who is also listed on state incorporation documents for the business, served in the Army and is disabled. Army records show Jones' brother also didn't receive a Bronze Star, and it provided no evidence of a service-related injury. Richard Jones did not respond to multiple calls and requests through his brother for comment.\n\n\"My brother and I, we are both veterans, so we just came up with a name to do business,\" Kayon Jones said. \"We're not saying we have a Bronze Star or anything.\"\n\nThe day after FEMA canceled the Bronze Star contract, it awarded a contract to OSC Solutions Inc. for plastic sheeting for Hurricane Maria victims. The West Palm Beach, Florida-based company has roughly two decades of federal contracting experience and has produced such supplies multiple times.\n\nThe FEMA spokesman, Roth, acknowledged the contract problems delayed delivery of tarps to Puerto Rico but said anyone who needs a tarp should now be able to get one.\n\nMore than 93,000 tarps have been sent to distribution centers on the island and now are available to cover homes, Roth said. The Army Corps of Engineers' \"Blue Roof\" program has provided 11,000 more reinforced tarps installed on homes by contractors.\n\nTo date, roughly $88 million in federal money has been awarded to four contractors, including Bronze Star, for tents and tarps, records show. The rescinded contracts with Bronze Star account for 35 percent of the total.\n\nMichael Byrne, Puerto Rico's FEMA coordination officer, estimated that at least 60,000 blue roofs are needed across the island. About 350 are installed each day, though he said that is expected to increase.\n\n\"One of the limiting factors is the availability of the material,\" Byrne said.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.

                  "text": "<p>The Federal Communications Commission is expected to repeal net neutrality rules Thursday, a move that will likely have major implications for internet service providers, startups and consumers.\n\nThe hotly contested move centers on a set of regulations passed in 2015 by a Democratic-controlled FCC that prohibited broadband companies from blocking websites, slowing connection speeds and charging for faster delivery of content.\n\nTo enforce the rules, the FCC classified broadband as a more highly regulated utility-like service under Title 2 of federal telecommunications law.\n\nBut in January, President Trump appointed Ajit Pai, a Republican and outspoken advocate for the repeal of net neutrality’s regulations, as FCC chairman. He’s argued that the fears behind the 2015 decision were “hysterical prophecies of doom” and said the “overhang of heavy-handed regulation” imposed by the FCC hurt the broadband industry and prevented investment in expanded networks.\n\nThursday’s vote is expected to fall along party lines, and the FCC is now controlled by a Republican majority.\n\nHere’s who could win or lose under the new rules:\n\nWinner: Internet service providers\n\nA major point of concern for net neutrality advocates is the idea of paid prioritization — the concept that a telecommunications company could charge an additional fee to transport certain forms of content at a higher speed through its network.\n\nBroadband companies and other internet service providers say they have no plans to offer paid prioritization, but some have been laying the groundwork for it in recent months.\n\nBroadband for America, a coalition of telecommunications industry groups and companies such as AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp., ran a full-page ad in the Washington Post that made commitments to customers to practices it said would preserve an “open internet.”\n\nThose included “no blocking of legal content,” “not throttling” data speeds and “no unfair discrimination” — but did not mention paid prioritization. For years, Comcast’s net neutrality web page had a commitment that the company wouldn’t prioritize internet traffic; that disappeared the day Pai unveiled his plan to repeal net neutrality rules.\n\nWinner: Large content providers\n\nIf net neutrality regulations are repealed, content providers such as Netflix or Google could end up paying more to ensure customers get the same service speed. In fact, both of these companies have lined up in favor of net neutrality — over the summer, Netflix posted a banner on its homepage showing its support, while Google elaborated on its views in a post on its public policy blog.\n\nThe Internet Assn., a trade group representing Amazon, Facebook, Google and other online companies, has said in an FCC filing that fast lanes would lead to the “cable-ization” of the internet because online content providers would have to negotiate deals with internet service providers to reach customers effectively.\n\nBut some of those same large content providers also have the money and the leverage of thousands of subscribers to negotiate deals with internet service providers, get in the so-called fast lanes for service speed and possibly give themselves a leg up on the competition. And networks like NBC, which is owned by Comcast, could potentially work with internet service providers to increase their speeds.\n\nWinner: Connection sensitive services\n\nPai singled out companies that provide services dependent on fast service, such as those that perform remote health monitoring of people with serious illnesses, as potential beneficiaries of the repeal. FCC officials have said a repeal could help advance the development of new technologies such as autonomous vehicles, which need guaranteed internet connections.\n\n“By ending the outright ban on paid prioritization, we hope to make it easier for consumers to benefit from services that need prioritization — such as latency-sensitive telemedicine,” he said in a recent speech.\n\nLoser: Startups\n\nOpponents of repeal say the so-called toll lanes could squeeze out burgeoning startups, which don’t have the money or influence to pay for faster content delivery.\n\nIn November, hundreds of companies, including tech firms Airbnb, Foursquare and Etsy, signed a letter to Pai urging the FCC to retain the net neutrality regulations. The letter specifically noted that the regulation rollback could put small- to medium-sized businesses at a disadvantage.\n\n“Without these rules, internet service providers will be able to favor certain websites and e-businesses, or the platforms they use to garner new customers, over others by putting the ones that can pay in fast lanes and slowing down or even blocking others,” the letter states.\n\nTo be determined: Consumers\n\nFree-market advocates say paid prioritization in other industries, such as highway toll roads, have spurred investment that benefit the larger public. In this case, that could mean more investment in broadband infrastructure, such as expanding and improving wireless and fiber networks that would increase internet access and overall data speeds.\n\nBut supporters of net neutrality say consumers could be charged extra to stream certain content if they don’t want to be hampered by network congestion. Others have warned that customer choice of internet service providers could shrink and prices of broadband service could increase.\n\n“Net neutrality rules keep the internet open for all and ensure consumers can access the websites and apps they — not their Internet service provider — choose,” Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, told the Times in April.\n\nsamantha.masunaga@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @smasunaga</p>",

Pai proposes allowing those practices as long as they are disclosed.\n\nMichael Powell, a former FCC chairman who heads a trade group representing major cable companies and broadcasters, told reporters earlier this week that internet providers would not block content because it would not make economic sense.\n\n“They make a lot of money on an open internet,” Powell said, adding it is “much more profitable” than a closed system. “This is not a pledge of good-heartedness, it’s a pledge in the shareholders’ interest.”\n\nThe chief executive of USTelecom, a lobbying group that represents internet providers and the broadband industry, said in a statement the industry has “renewed confidence to make the investments required to strengthen the nation’s networks and close the digital divide, especially in rural communities.”\n\nA University of Maryland poll released this week found that more than 80 percent of respondents opposed a repeal. The survey of 1,077 registered voters was conducted online by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland from Dec. 6-8.</p>",

Depending on how they decide to act, the repeal could have massive implications for the way all Americans use the internet.\n\nJust before the vote, the meeting was abruptly evacuated on Thursday afternoon \"on advice of security,\" said Pai. The five commissioners and people watching the meeting were asked to evacuate and leave their belongings in the room. It was unclear what prompted the evacuation, which lasted several minutes.\n\nDuring that time, a live feed showed several members of law enforcement walking around the room and what appeared to be a bomb sniffing canine. The meeting was re-adjourned at 1:02 pm ET.\n\n\"Prior to 2015, before these regulations were imposed, we had a free and open internet,\" Pai told NBC News. \"That is the future as well under a light touch, market-based approach. Consumers benefit, entrepreneurs benefit. Everybody in the internet economy is better off with a market based approach.\"\n\nComcast, the parent company of NBC News, celebrated the decision.\n\n\"Today’s action does not mark the ‘end of the Internet as we know it;’ rather it heralds in a new era of light regulation that will benefit consumers,\" said David L. Cohen, senior executive vice president and chief diversity officer of Comcast.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, the world's largest LGBTQ media advocacy organization, warned that stripping net neutrality rules would \"silence voices of already marginalized communities and render us invisible.\"\n\n“The internet is a lifeline for LGBTQ people to build community support networks and access LGBTQ resources on history, suicide prevention, and health — allowing broadband providers to regulate access is a direct and unconscionable attack on freedom of expression,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe arguments for and against\n\nIn short, net neutrality rules treat the internet like a utility, helping to control what consumers are charged and ensuring there is no paid prioritization — where internet service providers would be free to create so-called fast and slow lanes, allowing them to choose whether to block or slow certain websites.\n\nMany Silicon Valley giants support net neutrality rules and argue that without them, the internet service providers could become gatekeepers of information and ultimately hurt consumers.\n\nThe @FCC should stand up for the consumers it represents and protect #NetNeutrality on December 14. https://t.co/HWaNoGpmRY — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) December 12, 2017\n\nTech titans spoke out recently against the repeal: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; Vint Cerf, known as the \"father of the internet\"; Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web; and 19 other technology pioneers all called the FCC's plan \"rushed and technically incorrect,\" in a letter to the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet.\n\nPai believes his move will spur innovation and investment, giving consumers more options when choosing an internet plan. This strategy would mean internet service providers would have to disclose through the FCC or on a publicly available website if they engage in practices such as throttling, blocking, and paid prioritization.\n\n\"These light touch market-based rules are the right way to go forward,\" said Pai. \"The best evidence of that is the 1.5 trillion dollars in network investment that we saw between 1996 and 2015.\"\n\nThe vote did not come without plenty of controversy. The public feedback period, which closed in August, included a record-breaking 22 million comments. Among those were fake comments, including 2 million that used stolen identities, according to a statement from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office is investigating the process.\n\nAhead of the vote, Schneiderman warned that moving forward with the motion would “make a mockery of our public comment process and reward those who perpetrated this fraud to advance their own hidden agenda.”\n\nWhen will you notice a change?\n\nOther than the social media uproar, there won't be any immediate changes to your internet experience.\n\n\"Realistically, I don’t think consumers are going to see much of a difference,\" said Daniel Lyons, an associate professor of law at Boston College and a tech policy expert.\n\nWhile the ramifications won't be immediately felt, Commissioner Rosenworcel, who voted against gutting net neutrality, warned there could be long-term consequences.\n\n\"What this proposal would do is it would give broadband providers the legal right and the power to start blocking websites, or censoring content if they don't have a commercial relationship with that content. And so the open internet as we know it could change,\" she told NBC News. \"Perhaps not immediately, but over time. And I think that's troubling.\"</p>",

It also is the biggest win for Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations since taking over at the agency in January.\n\nDemocrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers.\n\nThe meeting, held amid protests online and in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington, was evacuated before the vote for about 10 minutes due to an unspecified security threat, and resumed after law enforcement with sniffer dogs checked the room.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the administration “supports the FCC’s efforts.

                  "text": "<p>The governor of Puerto Rico ordered all government agencies to reopen their books and initiate a recount and review of certified deaths that have occurred since Hurricane Maria, after weeks of reporting by various news outlets pointed to a possible severe undercount of storm fatalities.\n\nThe territorial government has attributed 64 official deaths to the storm and its aftermath, but the New York Times and the Center for Investigative Reporting in Puerto Rico have used vital statistics data to show that the number of deaths in the weeks after the storm far exceeded those of the same time period in previous years. The independent analyses put the death count at likely more than 1,000.\n\nGov. Ricardo Rossello told The Washington Post last week that there was “no intent to hide the number of deaths” relative to the storm and that “accountability broke down” in the wake of Hurricane Maria. But his government is committed to reevaluating death certificates that attributed many of the casualties to natural causes.\n\n“We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody,” the governor said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe government will now reexamine medical records, interview family members and call doctors for more information to determine whether deaths identified as “natural” need to be reclassified. Rossello cited the time it took to determine the final death toll for Hurricane Katrina to ask for patience as they conduct their review.\n\nIt’s been nearly three months since Maria knocked out power across the island and thousands are still in the dark. Physicians described horrific conditions inside hospitals and nursing homes in the immediate aftermath after the storm due to the lack of power.\n\nToday, less than half of the island has little or unreliable access to electricity, making life extremely difficult for the sick and elderly who depend on life-saving medical equipment, medicine and treatment to stay alive. Families consistently recounted stories to media outlets about loved ones dying after failing to receive dialysis treatments or having their respirators fail during the crisis. The Puerto Rico government also has documented four suicides and several other deaths related to a bacterial outbreak.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Rossello said he welcomes the news analyses but the government “cannot base any official fatality related to the hurricane count on statistical analysis.”\n\n“Every life is more than a number, and every death must have a name and vital information attached to it, as well as an accurate accounting of the facts related to their passing,” he said in the statement.\n\nRossello provided a flow chart detailing the processes by which his government has been documenting the deaths using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in recent weeks, Puerto Rico government officials acknowledged failures in the documentation complicated by the telecommunication difficulties. As each news report questioning the official death count published, members of Congress began calling for investigations into the death count.\n\nHector Pesquera, the Puerto Rico secretary of public safety, has repeatedly dismissed those media reports, saying his department, which includes the Department of Forensic Sciences, has followed the law as best they could under the circumstances. But when presented with evidence from news organizations about specific cases, Pesquera has ordered reviews in recent weeks that resulted in their certification, adding those individuals to the official death count.\n\n“The number is likely to go up,” the governor told the Washington Post last week. There is “no agenda to minimize...but to do it diligently.”</p>",

                  "text": "<p>A massive influx of Puerto Rico residents displaced by recent hurricanes is transforming communities in Florida and other states, and a conservative group is moving quickly to woo them ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe Libre Institute, an offshoot of the Libre Initiative, a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, is launching new outreach programs this week in the Orlando area designed to provide English-language courses and civics lessons to thousands of Puerto Ricans living at least temporarily in Central Florida as the island continues rebuilding after deadly hurricanes Irma and Maria last fall.\n\nFull power has not yet been restored on the island, and Florida officials say more than 300,000 people have at least passed through the Sunshine State from Puerto Rico in pursuit of new opportunities or temporary shelter. Thousands of young island residents have been enrolled in Florida schools while their parents seek work and housing.\n\nResidents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens who can participate in presidential primaries but cannot cast a vote for president — unless they move to the mainland and register to vote. With hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans leaving the island, they are poised to transform several communities in Florida and bolster fledgling island communities in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas, while adding to their already large numbers in New Jersey, New York and parts of New England. The ongoing churn has the potential to transform the political dynamic ahead of November’s midterms, especially in down-ballot races, in which even a few hundred new voters could make a difference.\n\nThe Libre Institute’s “Welcome to Florida” classes will launch this week at the group’s offices in the Orlando area, part of an initial $100,000 commitment by the group that is set to grow in the coming weeks as the program expands to centers in Miami and Tampa, two other parts of the state attracting Puerto Ricans.\n\nThe group is relying on partners such as Florida Hospital Orlando, Spanish-language radio stations and a network of churches across the region to help spread the word about the classes. State officials greeting Puerto Ricans arriving at airports in the state also are referring them to Libre for assistance, according to David Velasquez, deputy state director for Florida for the Libre Initiative, a sister group focused on political advocacy that is overseeing the courses.\n\n“We’re talking to a lot of people who’ve lost everything,” he said.\n\nAs it has elsewhere since at least 2012, the group is offering English-language classes, courses on how to update professional licenses, and civics courses designed to highlight the group’s focus on economic empowerment. What the classes will not include are direct appeals to vote for certain candidates or causes, because the institute is a nonprofit barred from direct political activity.\n\n“We want people to make an educated decision for themselves. We really feel that in the Hispanic community, people need to know these topics,” Velasquez said. “You have people coming to Florida from all over the world, and they don’t understand how the system works. A lot of things get miscommunicated or misunderstood. So, we want to educate people about the principles that are close to our hearts, and then leave it to them.”\n\nIn the past, Libre has offered driver’s license classes, tax preparation help, wellness checkups, scholarships and food giveaways in Texas, Colorado, Florida and other states. It has bought ads touting the “free market,” smaller government and school choice, and its officials are a growing presence on Spanish-language news stations, where they talk about the virtues of “self-reliance.”\n\nDaniel Garza, president of the Libre Initiative, said much of the group’s work “is from personal experience.” Garza, who grew up in South Texas, said his parents “worked too hard for too long until they hit a time of prosperity. It was over 20 years in the orchards working across America, with no English training and no citizenship — thus, barriers of opportunities.”\n\nDaniel Garza, president of the Libre Initiative, spoke to hundreds of Latinos attending a class at the Eastern Indoor Swapmeet in Las Vegas on April 26, 2015. (The Washington Post)\n\n“The people from Puerto Rico are citizens, but what we can do is help guide them to a place where they can remove those barriers and move up the economic ladder,” Garza said.\n\nDemocrats and progressive organizations have sounded the alarm about Libre’s work in the past, accusing the group of skirting nonprofit laws by handing out ideological material; collecting names, email addresses and phone numbers; and basically doing the early legwork that Republicans should otherwise be doing to win over new voters.\n\nDoing anything to track down and even indirectly woo potential Latino Republican voters could be critical next year in Florida, which faces an open gubernatorial race, a competitive reelection fight for Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and a handful of congressional races that could tip the balance of power in the House of Representatives.\n\nGarza insisted that there will be “no specific advocacy for any specific issue or candidate.”\n\n“It’s a win-win. They get the needed guidance and tools they’re going to need to transition faster. But it’s also an opportunity for us to educate them on the ideas that we feel make America strong — the principles of economic freedom, ” he said.</p>",

Cardin (D-Md.) and Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) in November 2017. Schumer said Monday that there is full caucus support to override the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of the net neutrality rules. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nFifty senators have endorsed a legislative measure to override the Federal Communications Commission's recent decision to deregulate the broadband industry, top Democrats said Monday.\n\nThe tally leaves supporters just one Republican vote shy of the 51 required to pass a Senate resolution of disapproval, in a legislative gambit aimed at restoring the agency's net neutrality rules.\n\nThose rules, which banned Internet providers from blocking or slowing down websites, were swept away in a December vote led by Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. Republicans had argued that the rules were too restrictive for industry, while Democrats said they provided a vital consumer protection.\n\nThe resolution aims to overturn the FCC's decision and prohibit the agency from passing similar measures in the future. It has the support of all 49 Democratic senators as well as one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.\n\n“With full caucus support,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the lawmakers spearheading the effort, “it’s clear that Democrats are committed to fighting to keep the Internet from becoming the Wild West where ISPs are free to offer premium service to only the wealthiest customers while average consumers are left with far inferior options.”\n\nTo pass the Senate, backers of the resolution must recruit one more Republican member to their ranks. The measure must survive the Republican-majority House and be signed by President Trump to take effect.\n\nAfter an independent agency makes a decision — such as the FCC's net neutrality deregulation — federal lawmakers have a window of 60 legislative days to reverse the move under the Congressional Review Act. As of last Tuesday, 40 senators had signed on to the resolution to challenge the FCC under the CRA. Since then, 10 more have joined the effort.\n\nDemocrats have said they plan to make net neutrality a midterm campaign issue, forcing vulnerable GOP candidates to stand with their party and adopt a position that, according to some surveys, is at odds with that of the broader public.\n\nFor years, well-heeled lawyers and lobbyists for the telecom and cable industries battled the equally formidable influence of Silicon Valley over the ground rules that would determine how the Internet functioned in the future.\n\nThat debate broke into the public consciousness in 2015, as the FCC under Chairman Tom Wheeler took the step of regulating Internet providers like legacy telephone companies. The new rules subjected companies such as AT&T and Verizon to strict bans on the blocking or slowing of Internet content. They also banned the practice of speeding up other content in exchange for extra fees, opened the door to new consumer privacy rules and even raised the prospect of future controls over the price of Internet service.\n\nIndustry groups sought to have the rules repealed — filing a lawsuit against the FCC that ultimately ended in defeat. Broadband providers said, among other things, that the FCC rules prevented them from developing innovative new business models. A three-judge panel ultimately sided with the FCC.\n\nWith the election of Trump, Republicans who opposed the regulations received another chance. Pai, who had been an outspoken critic of the rules, became the FCC's chairman, and quickly moved to dismantle the net neutrality rules.\n\nMuch as the broadband industry did in 2015, today's opponents of the FCC have vowed to open a new chapter of litigation and congressional action to reverse the vote. The first lawsuits to challenge Pai's decision could come as early as the end of this month. And a vote on the CRA could take place this summer, depending on what Congress has on its schedule.\n\nOpposition to the deregulation has reached new levels over the past few months. As the FCC prepared for its vote last year, the agency said it had received derogatory comments toward Pai in the issue's electronic public docket. The harassment continued offline, with Pai telling Fox News that protesters had posted signs near his home aimed at his children.\n\n“I understand that people are passionate about policy, but the one thing in America that should remain sacred is that families, wives and kids, should remain out of it,” Pai said at the time. “And stop harassing us at our homes.”\n\nPai has canceled at least two public appearances since then — including a major annual address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas — amid reports of security concerns.</p>",

                  "text": "<p> Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed the first major lawsuit Tuesday to block the repeal of the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rules, marking the start of a high-stakes legal battle over the future of the Internet.\n\nThe FCC's rules had prohibited Internet providers from slowing down or blocking websites. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is leading the suit, said that the FCC’s repeal of the net neutrality rules was “arbitrary\" and \"capricious” and violates federal law.\n\nThe multi-state lawsuit comes just a day after Democrats in the Senate said they were inching closer to the votes needed for a legislative measure to help overturn the FCC’s rules. The resolution aims to reverse the FCC's decision and block the agency from passing similar measures in the future. It has garnered the support of all 49 Democratic senators as well as one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nTuesday’s lawsuit, which includes California, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Illinois, seized on that momentum and represents another avenue for supporters of the net neutrality rules to undo the repeal.\n\nThe net neutrality rules were dismantled in a December vote led by Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. Republicans had argued that the existing rules stymied industry investment, while Democrats maintained that they served as a vital consumer protection.\n\n“An open internet – and the free exchange of ideas it allows – is critical to our democratic process,” said Schneiderman in a statement. “The repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers – allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online.\"\n\nIn Tuesday’s filing, the attorneys general requested that an appellate court review the FCC’s new policy and determine that it is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nThe FCC is expected to defend its decision by pointing to prior cases in which the agency had changed its mind on how to regulate businesses under its jurisdiction. Lawyers representing the broadband industry have said the FCC will have a strong case if it can demonstrate solid reasoning.\n\nThe FCC gets a “significant amount of discretion” to switch directions on policy, said Matthew Brill, a partner at the firm Latham and Watkins who represents NCTA — The Internet and Television Association, a major cable industry trade group, in a recent interview.\n\n“When the court ruled [last time],” said Brill, “it emphasized it wasn't assessing the wisdom of that policy — it was just upholding the agency's decision-making under the broad leeway it gets.”\n\nUntil the FCC decision is published in the Federal Register — a process that could take days or weeks — appeals courts may reject any lawsuits submitted on net neutrality, on the grounds that it is too soon to file. But the state attorneys general said they issued their challenge in order to ensure their suit is included in the judicial lottery, the process that determines which court will hear the case.\n\nOutside defenders of the FCC, meanwhile, could launch their own court petition to have the rules reviewed. Doing so would allow industry groups to try to \"win\" the judicial lottery by having the case heard in a court that is considered friendlier to business interests.\n\nTuesday's suit was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court upheld the FCC's net neutrality rules in 2016, handing the telecom industry a major defeat.\n\nAll 22 attorneys general listed in the lawsuit are Democrats. In addition to the District and the states already mentioned, the states that have joined the legal challenge include: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nOther supporters of net neutrality, including Mozilla and Public Knowledge, also filed suits in the same court Tuesday, out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\"We filed in the event a court determines the appropriate date is today,\" said Mozilla in a blog post. \"The FCC or a court may accept this order or require us and others to refile at a later date.\"\n\nThe FCC declined to comment.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>(Reuters) - A group of 21 U.S. state attorneys general filed suit to challenge the Federal Communications Commission’s decision to do away with net neutrality on Tuesday while Democrats said they needed just one more vote in the Senate to repeal the FCC ruling.\n\nThe state attorneys, including those of California, New York and Virginia as well as the District of Columbia, filed a petition to challenge the action, calling it “arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion” and saying that it violated federal laws and regulations.\n\nThe petition was filed with a federal appeals court in Washington as Senate Democrats said on Tuesday they had the backing of 50 members of the 100-person chamber for repeal, leaving them just one vote short of a majority.\n\nEven if Democrats could win a majority in the Senate, a repeal would also require winning a vote in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a greater majority, and would still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Ed Markey said in a statement that all 49 Democrats in the upper chamber backed the repeal. Earlier this month, Republican Senator Susan Collins said she would back the effort to overturn the FCC’s move. Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie.\n\nTrump backed the FCC action, the White House said last month, and overturning a presidential veto requires a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nStates said the lawsuit was filed in an abundance of caution because, typically, a petition to challenge would not be filed until the rules legally take effect, which is expected later this year.\n\nInternet advocacy group Free Press, the Open Technology Institute and Mozilla Corp filed similar protective petitions on Tuesday.\n\nThe FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse rules introduced in 2015 that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization. The new rules will not take effect for at least three months, the FCC has said.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the issue would be a major motivating factor for the young voters the party is courting.\n\nA trade group representing major tech companies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc said it would support legal challenges to the reversal.\n\nThe FCC vote in December marked a victory for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and handed them power over what content consumers can access on the internet. It was the biggest win for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations.\n\nWhile the FCC order grants internet providers sweeping new powers it does require public disclosure of any blocking practices. Internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers obtain online content.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, a Republican, said in an interview on Tuesday he planned to hold a hearing on paid prioritization. He has urged Democrats to work constructively on a legislative solution to net neutrality “to bring certainty and clarity going forward and ban behaviors like blocking and throttling.”\n\nHe said he does not believe a vote to overturn the FCC decision would get a majority in the U.S. House. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat, said Tuesday that his bill to reverse the FCC decision had 80 co-sponsors.\n\nPaid prioritization is part of American life, Walden said. “Where do you want to sit on the airplane? Where do you want to sit on Amtrak?” he said.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>With indications that special counsel Robert Mueller is seeking an interview with President Trump, here are some burning questions his team will want to ask. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III is seeking to question President Trump in the coming weeks about his decisions to oust national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James B. Comey, according to two people familiar with his plans.\n\nMueller’s interest in the events that led Trump to push out Flynn and Comey indicates that his investigation is intensifying its focus on possible efforts by the president or others to obstruct or blunt the special counsel’s probe.\n\nTrump’s attorneys have crafted some negotiating terms for the president’s interview with Mueller’s team, one that could be presented to the special counsel as soon as next week, according to the two people.\n\nThe president’s legal team hopes to provide Trump’s testimony in a hybrid form — answering some questions in a face-to-face interview and others in a written statement.\n\nThose discussions come amid signs of stepped-up activity by the special counsel. Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was interviewed for several hours by Mueller’s investigators, according to Justice Department officials.\n\nPresident Trump has said privately that he is not worried about speaking to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. (Jabin Botsford; Kevin Lamarque/The Washington Post; Reuters)\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel’s office, Peter Carr, declined to comment. A White House spokesman referred questions to the president’s legal team. Two attorneys for Trump, Jay Sekulow and John Dowd, declined to comment\n\nWithin the past two weeks, the special counsel’s office has indicated to the White House that the two central subjects that investigators wish to discuss with the president are the departures of Flynn and Comey and the events surrounding their firings.\n\nFlynn resigned last February after The Washington Post reported that he misled Vice President Pence and other administration officials about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\n\nLate last year, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Trump then tweeted that “he had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.” Previously, the White House had cited only the false statements to Pence as a rationale for dismissing Flynn.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May, several days after the then-FBI director told Congress he could not comment on whether there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Comey later testified that the president had asked him several months earlier whether he could see a way to “letting Flynn go.”\n\nMueller has also expressed interest in Trump’s efforts to remove Jeff Sessions as attorney general or pressure him into quitting, according to a person familiar with the probe who said the special counsel was seeking to determine whether there was a “pattern” of behavior by the president.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump declined to say whether he would grant an interview to Mueller and his team, deflecting questions on the topic by saying there had been “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Jan. 23 that President Trump \"is going to be fully cooperative with the special counsel.\" (Reuters)\n\n“We’ll see what happens,” Trump said when asked directly about meeting with the special counsel.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump has told his team of lawyers that he is not worried about being interviewed, because he has done nothing wrong, according to people familiar with his views. His attorneys also support a sit-down, as long as there are clear parameters and topics.\n\nHowever, some of Trump’s close advisers and friends fear a face-to-face interview with Mueller could put the president in legal jeopardy. A central worry, they say, is Trump’s lack of precision in his speech and his penchant for hyperbole.\n\nPeople close to Trump have tried to warn him for months that Mueller is a “killer,” in the words of one associate, noting that the special counsel has shown interest in the president’s actions.\n\nRoger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, said he should try to avoid an interview at all costs, saying agreeing to such a session would be a “suicide mission.”\n\n“I find it to be a death wish. Why would you walk into a perjury trap?” Stone said. “The president would be very poorly advised to give Mueller an interview.”</p>",

                  "headline": "<strong>Mueller set to question Bannon on Flynn and Comey</strong>",
                  "text": "<p>Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's team wants to question former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon about the firings of national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey, according to two people familiar with the investigation.\n\nBannon is set to interview with Mueller by the end of the month, these people say, as the special counsel's investigation moves closer to President Donald Trump's inner circle. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a witness to the firing of Comey, was interviewed last week, the Justice Department confirmed Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to the Comey and Flynn firings, key issues from Bannon's time in the White House are likely to include Trump's decision to fire then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates and any pressure the President may have exerted on Sessions about the FBI investigation into Russia's interference with the election.\n\nBannon's attorney has said that his client will not be able to use the protections of executive privilege to dodge questions when he meets with Mueller's team. Last week, Bannon infuriated lawmakers from both parties after he refused to answer questions before the House Intelligence Committee about his work during the presidential transition or in the West Wing.\n\nFrom his early days in the administration, Bannon was wary about the Russia investigation seeping into operations in the West Wing. He had only been working as chief strategist for a few months when he began trying to avoid meetings and discussions that could one day wind up of interest to investigators in the various Russia probes, according to sources familiar with the situation.\n\nBut his efforts to shield himself fell short.\n\nBannon was a key force in lobbying Trump to bring on attorney Marc Kasowitz and spokesman Mark Corallo as his first legal team that wrangled with Russia issues, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. But it took months for the administration to stand up its current structure of lawyers, both inside and outside the White House, to handle the daily deluge of Russia revelations.\n\nIn the meantime, Bannon and other top administration officials -- including former chief of staff Reince Priebus and current White House counsel Don McGahn -- sometimes found themselves racing from the West Wing to the residence to huddle with the President about emerging developments in the Russia investigation.\n\nWhile Bannon may not have played a pivotal role in some of the key decisions that are raising alarms with investigators, even his knowledge of the President's mindset at the time could come into play.\n\nBannon was largely cut out of the President's decision to fire Comey, a key element of Mueller's obstruction of justice investigation. Since leaving the White House, Bannon has publicly slammed the move, referring to it as the biggest mistake in modern political history in a September 2017 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" But Bannon could still provide insight into internal White House deliberations and Trump's state of mind as critical events like this unfolded.\n\nEven before his tenure in the White House, Bannon had been privy to a number of meetings and decisions that could be of interest to the special counsel and congressional investigators.\n\n'Fire and Fury' revelations\n\nThe former Breitbart News executive's propensity for spouting off in colorful fashion appears to have raised investigators' interest in Bannon. Mueller's team could use Michael Wolff's book \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\" as a blueprint for their Bannon interview, in addition to whatever evidence the team has already gathered.\n\n\"They will look for prior writings as well as statements by the witness, and they will be analyzed to determine whether they provide a basis for any line of questioning,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN contributor and a former prosecutor who was a special assistant to Mueller. \"It wouldn't surprise me if Mueller's team went through Michael Wolff's book and pulled out what they might want to ask about.\"\n\nIn the book, Bannon said Trump \"kept trying\" to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Kremlin strongman rebuffed Trump during his trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in December 2013.\n\nBannon also claimed that Mueller's investigation is sure to lead back to money laundering.\n\n\"You realize where this is going. ... This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose (senior prosecutor Andrew) Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy,\" Bannon is quoted as saying in Wolff's book. \"Their path to f***ing Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner. ... It's as plain as a hair on your face.\"\n\nBannon also said Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers, are \"terrified\" that Mueller will investigate the finances of their respective business empires.\n\nIt's not important what Bannon thinks, Zeldin explained. What matters is whether Bannon can provide investigators with verifiable facts to support his claims. That's what Mueller will be looking for.\n\nTrump Tower meeting with the Russians\n\nInvestigators are likely to press Bannon over the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nBannon also claimed in the Wolff book that there was \"zero\" chance that Trump Jr. didn't introduce the Russians to his father, an allegation Trump Jr. and others have denied.\n\nThe misleading Trump Tower statement\n\nBannon told the House Intelligence Committee that he had had conversations about the Trump Jr. meeting with the Russians with Priebus, Corallo and Sean Spicer, who was White House press secretary at the time, according to a report in Axios\n\n\"Bannon immediately realized he'd slipped up and disclosed conversations he wasn't supposed to discuss, because they happened while he was chief strategist in the White House,\" the Axios report said.\n\n\"The meeting -- and the subsequent drafting of a misleading statement on Air Force One -- has become one of the most important focal points of the Russia investigations, both on Capitol Hill and within Mueller's team, because it provides one of the clearest indications that the Trump campaign was willing to entertain collusion with Russians,\" the report said.\n\nMichael Flynn's calls to the Russian ambassador\n\nMueller's investigators may also have questions about Bannon's activities during the presidential transition, a period that lawmakers on Capitol Hill were interested in when Bannon made his first appearance before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nFor instance, Bannon was forwarded an email during the transition detailing the plan for then-incoming national security adviser Flynn to talk with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe email is an important part of the investigation because it shows that Trump transition officials knew that Flynn would be discussing sanctions, despite later denials from Vice President Mike Pence and others.\n\nAffiliation with Cambridge Analytica\n\nOne of the other lingering questions in the Russia investigation is whether there was any collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign's data team and the Russian government, which also used social media to target specific voters during the campaign.\n\nBoth sides flatly deny any collusion. But Bannon is close to the Mercer family of GOP megadonors. They were major backers to Trump's campaign and support a variety of conservative groups, including Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked on the Trump campaign. Bannon served on the company's board before joining Trump's campaign.\n\nCambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who contacted WikiLeaks in June 2016 to ask about Clinton's emails , testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December. And Mueller asked for the company's emails last fall, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJust three months after Nix contacted Wikileaks, it exchanged private messages on Twitter with Trump Jr. In most of the messages from late September 2016, which Trump Jr. later released to the public , WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share its materials on social media. Trump Jr. sent an email about the conversation to Bannon and a group of other senior Trump campaign officials, according to The Atlantic, and Mueller could press for additional information on those exchanges.\n\nErik Prince's secret Russia meeting\n\nDuring the presidential transition, Bannon also attended one meeting that potentially triggered a series of events -- stretching all the way to a tiny island chain in the Indian Ocean -- which congressional investigators are scrutinizing.\n\nIn December 2016, Bannon joined Kushner and Flynn for a meeting at Trump Tower with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. After the meeting, Erik Prince -- a businessman, Trump donor and Bannon ally -- reached out to the prince and said he had authorization to act as an informal emissary for Trump, according to The Washington Post\n\nPrince, founder of the private security company Blackwater USA and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, flew to the Seychelles one month later and met Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, according to Prince's testimony at the House Intelligence Committee\n\nPrince and the White House both deny that the Trump transition had anything to do with the planning of the meeting. Prince testified that it was purely a business meeting and that nobody authorized him to represent the Trump team.\n\nInteractions with George Papadopoulos\n\nMueller's team, as well as congressional investigators, could also question Bannon about his interactions with Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. He is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation.\n\nPapadopoulos' fiancée, Simona Mangiante, told CNN that Papadopoulos communicated with Bannon and other high-ranking officials during the campaign and was more involved in the campaign's activities than the White House has acknowledged.\n\nThis story has been updated with more detail from the Axios reporting.</p>",

                  "headline": "Now weighing in on net neutrality: AT&T CEO and ... Burger King?",
                  "text": "<p>Would you pay extra for Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube? That's how they do it in England, reports Jefferson Graham. Could that happen here too, in the wake of the relaxed FCC Net Neutrality rules?\n\nSolutions for the net neutrality conundrum landed Wednesday from two very different authorities: the CEO of a company promising to deliver fast Internet and a company devoted to promising fast food.\n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson paid for a letter he penned to appear as a full-page advertisement in several newspapers and online. In it, he called for Congress to pass an Internet Bill of Rights to solve the tumultuous quest for net neutrality protections.\n\nBurger King cooked up a different approach, equating broadband speeds to burger delivery times as a way to educate consumers.\n\nNet neutrality remains a hot-button issue as new rules passed last month by the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission are set to go into effect in the coming weeks, replacing stricter net neutrality rules that were repealed. AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and other telecom providers lobbied for an end to the older Obama-era rules, arguing they were too heavy-handed.\n\nBut the FCC's vote far from settled the situation. Attorneys general for 21 states and the District of Columbia have filed a suit to challenge the new rules, an echo of past legal battles — some brought by the telecom industry— over regulations passed by the agency.\n\nThe principle of net neutrality — that Internet service providers (ISPs) should give consumers access to all legal content and applications on an equal basis, without favoring some sources or blocking others — has been in a push-me-pull-you state for more than a decade.\n\nA Congressional solution is needed to provide stability for consumers and the marketplace, Stephenson says in his letter posted on AT&T's web site and published in outlets including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and USA Today.\n\n\"Regulators under four different presidents have taken four different approaches. Courts have overturned regulatory decisions,\" Stephenson says in the letter. \"Regulators have reversed their predecessors. And because the Internet is so critical to everyone, it’s understandably confusing and a bit concerning when you hear the rules have recently changed, yet again.\"\n\nUnder the new rules passed in December, Internet service providers (ISPs) are required to disclose if they block sites or give priority to their own content more than others — for instance, should Comcast boost its NBCUniversal news sites to run faster than competitors such as Time Warner's CNN.com. The FCC says pressure from consumers will act as the best deterrent to ISPs favoring one site over another.\n\nThe previous rules went further: they prevented ISPs from any blocking or slowing of websites, and from charging more for others to run faster. A range of consumer groups, Internet pioneers and large tech companies — from Google to Microsoft — argued against the repeal.\n\nThe telecom industry, while pushing for a repeal of the previous rules, has said it, too, believes in the concept of an \"open Internet\" and wouldn't do most of what the older rules were designed to prevent, such as blocking or slowing legal content. But they've stopped short of saying they wouldn't charge more for faster Internet, a cost that could be passed to consumers.\n\n\"We don’t block websites. We don’t censor online content. And we don’t throttle, discriminate, or degrade network performance based on content. Period,\" said Stephenson.\n\nMore: Democrats propose legislation to preserve net neutrality in Tennessee\n\nBeyond the attorneys generals' lawsuit, some states are taking action themselves. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday signed an executive order to protect net neutrality rules in the state.\n\nThe internet must remain free and open to all. I just signed an executive order to protect #NetNeutrality in New York. pic.twitter.com/qMdfj3tVXd — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 24, 2018\n\nAnd some in Congress are seeking to overturn the recent FCC's action or craft legislation.\"Legislation would not only ensure consumers’ rights are protected, but it would provide consistent rules of the road for all internet companies across all websites, content, devices and applications,\" said Stephenson, who said AT&T would work with Congress and consumer groups to achieve an Internet Bill of Rights.\n\nSome pro-net neutrality supporters called Stephenson's stance hypocritical. AT&T not only challenged the 2015 rules passed by the FCC, but also has \"promoted state laws that ban communities from building their own broadband networks,\" said Gigi Sohn, who served as former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's counselor and is now a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy.\n\nOn a humorous note, Burger King is weighing in on the net neutrality issue in an attempt to make it easier to understand. In a video released Wednesday, the restaurant chain showed how an experiment called Whopper Neutrality educated guests about the issue.\n\nGuests who paid a higher price for Whoppers — in essence, paying for a fast food fast lane — got their burgers faster than other customers at one of its Los Angeles stores. Near the end of the video, Burger King posted the link to Change.org/SavetheNet where viewers can sign a petition in support of the 2015 rules recently overturned.\n\nAnd at the video's end, the Burger King character takes a swig from a giant Reese's mug, a tweak at FCC Chairman Pai who has one of his own.\n\nBut at its heart, Burger King is serious about the issue, said the company's global chief marketing officer Fernando Machado in a statement. \"We believe the internet should be like Burger King restaurants, a place that doesn't prioritize and welcomes everyone,\" he said. \"That is why we created this experiment, to call attention to the potential effects of net neutrality.\"\n\nBurger King’s video lesson \"demonstrates how the American public is likely to be ripped off now that we’ve lost\" the 2015 net neutrality rules, said Chris Lewis, vice president of Public Knowledge, a non-profit group that supports an open internet.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DCoyer</p>",

                  "text": "Really want it your way?\n\nWhen it comes to accessing the internet, Burger King's latest social experiment is showing the fast-food company is in full support of net neutrality — the federal policy that requires all internet traffic to be treated equally by internet service providers.\n\nThe video, released Wednesday and entitled \"WHOPPER Neutrality,\" pranks real customers and aims to \"help people understand how the repeal of Net Neutrality will impact their lives,\" according to Burger King.\n\nHow would you explain the repeal of Net Neutrality? We did it with the Whopper. Watch the video below: pic.twitter.com/9EWjtbenv8 — Burger King (@BurgerKing) January 24, 2018\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission voted in December to scrap the Obama-era net neutrality rules, marking a major victory for large internet service providers.\n\nEssentially, the FCC's decision could allow the service providers to create so-called fast and slow lanes for subscribers — and open up higher fees that could be passed down to users.\n\nBut some public officials, activists and tech companies, including Apple, Google and Amazon, have been in favor of keeping net neutrality rules in place, fearing that service providers could also block or slow access to certain websites.\n\nComcast, one of the nation's biggest service providers, has said it has \"no plans\" to create fast lanes and \"will not\" block or slow sites. (Comcast is part of Comcast NBCUniversal, the owner of NBC News.)\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear why Burger King has decided to take a side on the issue.\n\nThe fast-food chain previously went off-brand last fall in an anti-bullying video that also tricked real guests. In 2014, the company also unveiled a Proud Whopper that was sold in San Francisco and came in a rainbow-colored wrapper that read: \"We are all the same inside.\"\n\nAs part of the latest prank, the Whopper — Burger King's flagship sandwich — is sold to unsuspecting customers in tiers. While download and upload speeds are measured in Mbps, or megabits per second, Whoppers in the video are sold based on \"making burgers per second.\"\n\nSo for a \"slow Mbps,\" customers were asked to pay $4.99. For a \"fast Mbps,\" they had to fork over $12.99. And for \"hyperfast Mbps,\" the Whoppers cost $25.99 apiece.\n\nWhile many of the customers balked at the higher prices — a Whopper typically goes for just over $4 — at least one man in the video paid the premium.\n\n\"Are you kidding me? You paid $26 for a Whopper?\" one woman asked him.\n\n\"He's higher priority, so ...,\" responded a worker.\n\nThe video ends with Burger King saying, \"The internet should be like the Whopper: the same for everyone.\"\n\nThe fate of net neutrality, however, remains unresolved. Attorneys general for 21 states and Washington, D.C., are suing to block its repeal, but internet changes could go into effect as early as this year.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>LOS ANGELES — Ajit Pai, the controversial chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, is under investigation by the FCC Inspector General for his ties to a broadcaster, according to lawmakers.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings’ (D-MD) requested the investigation, saying that Pai and aides improperly pushed for rule changes to benefit Sinclair Broadcasting in its attempt to acquire Tribune Media.\n\n“For months I have been trying to get to the bottom of the allegations about Chairman Pai’s relationship with Sinclair Broadcasting,” Pallone said, in a statement. “I am particularly concerned about reports that Chairman Pai may have coordinated with Sinclair to time a series of Commission actions to benefit the company. I am grateful to the FCC’s Inspector General that he has decided to take up this important investigation.”\n\nThe FCC and Sinclair didn't respond to USA TODAY requests for comment.\n\nIn April, Pai suggested changing rules about how many stations broadcasters could own. Sinclair followed up with a $3.9 billion deal to snap up Tribune, thanks to the new rules.\n\nThe question for the Inspector General: was Pai's push for the new rules improper and were they timed to benefit Sinclair.\n\nSinclair is already the largest U.S. broadcaster with 191 stations. Tribune brings another 42 stations to the deal.\n\nAttorneys general in four states — Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island — have come out in opposition to the merger, saying that the bolstered Sinclair would have too much national power and could stifle points of view in local markets.\n\nThey're also concerned that Sinclair, which some critics say forced local stations to provide favorable coverage to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump's campaign at the expense of rival Hillary Clinton, has too cozy a relationship with the Administration.\n\nSinclair's post-merger reach of 72% reach of U.S. homes \"is well above the cap that Congress imposed in order to protect viewpoint diversity and localism,\" wrote the AG's to the FCC. A federal mandate prohibits the reach of a single local broadcaster of beyond 39% of U.S. TV homes.\n\nSinclair has said the merger would allow the new company to better serve local viewers with expanded local coverage, better facilities and more programming, delivered in part by operational efficiencies.\n\nRepublican appointee Pai last year led the agency's successful rollback of Obama-era net neutrality regulations. The decision, which he and the telecom industry said was necessary to remove burdens that hindered investments in broadband, was fought by tech companies and privacy groups and sparked tens of millions of public comments. He has skipped some public appearances because of death threats, according to reports.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2odf5R9</p>",

Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie.\n\nOn Friday, a coalition of more than 20 state attorneys general and advocacy groups agreed to withdraw a protective petition filed in January that sought to preserve the right to sue.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said the office reached an agreement to withdraw “the original petition and will simply refile it once the final rule is published.

                  "text": "<p> A new Burger King ad is trying to teach customers about net neutrality, using Whoppers to criticize the recent repeal of regulations that proponents said ensured equal access to the Internet. Time\n\nThe days are now truly numbered for the federal regulations that prevent Internet service providers from blocking, throttling or prioritizing content on their broadband networks.\n\nAnd for the groups who want those Net-neutrality rules to stay, the race is on.\n\nTwo months ago, the Federal Communications Commission repealed rules that prevented Internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking or slowing legal content. In their place, the agency passed lighter rules that require cable and telecom companies to disclose any slowing as well as prioritization of their own content or that of their partners, with the idea that consumer pressure would force ISPs to play fair.\n\nBut the new rules — backed by cable and telecom companies — do not officially go into effect until 60 days after the regulations appear in the Federal Register, which happened Thursday.\n\nThat means proponents of the older, stronger so-called Net-neutrality rules, which include several state attorneys general and coalitions of tech companies, have about two months to prevent the new regulations from going into effect in April.\n\nISPs such as AT&T and Comcast have said they won't block or throttle legal websites, though some have left open the option of charging more for some content.\n\nRegardless, several initiatives are underway in Congress and at state and local governmental levels to reinstate the 2015 Net-neutrality rules, supported by President Obama and passed by a Democrat-led FCC. Those regulations also prohibited ISPs from charging content providers for \"fast lanes\" that more quickly deliver content.\n\nAt the top of Net-neutrality supporters' wish list: passage of a Congressional Review Act measure to reinstate the original rules. The 1996 CRA lets Congress pass a resolution blocking a rule enacted by a federal agency if it acts within 60 days of notification (via the Federal Register).\n\nA vote on such a resolution is highly unlikely as it requires Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, both Republicans, to schedule a vote.\n\nTo drum up public support for a vote, Sens. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., will host a press event Tuesday as part of a planned Net Neutrality National Day of Action. They will be joined by representatives from several pro-Net-neutrality consumer groups.\n\nMarkey has 50 supporters in the Senate: 47 Democrats, Independents Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Angus King (Maine) and Republican Susan Collins (Maine). In the House, Doyle has 143 Democratic co-sponsors for a measure.\n\n“Nobody should be able to influence what videos you watch, which sites you read and which services you use, but the Trump FCC’s action will take that decision away from all of us, jeopardizing free speech and small business innovation,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., in a statement. \"The fight officially begins today to protect the free and open internet.”\n\nIn February 2015, when the FCC passed the Open Internet order, drafted to enforce Net-neutrality rules, then-Chairman Tom Wheeler said the measure was needed because \"broadband providers have both the economic incentive and the technological capability to abuse their gatekeeper position.\"\n\nBut current Chairman Ajit Pai, who voted against the rules in 2015, considered them intrusive, unneeded burden on ISPs. His proposal, passed in December and now published, eased the protections and overturned the 2015 rules' reliance on Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 allowing the agency to oversee ISPs as if they are utilities or \"common carriers\" like the traditional landline phone system.\n\nThose who consider these new regulations too lax are looking beyond Congress for remedies. State officials, tech companies and consumer advocacy groups have taken their own actions to overturn them.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, joined by 22 other states, officially filed a suit federal court in Washington, D.C., challenging the FCC's new rules. In December, Schneiderman said he would take such action and in January announced he had nearly two dozen other states joining him in the suit.\n\nThe @FCC may have made its illegal rollback of #netneutrality official, but this fight is just getting started.\n\nOur coalition of 23 AGs just officially filed suit to protect the free and open internet. #SaveTheInternethttps://t.co/uqznZsiUpspic.twitter.com/dGQEZlgsfc — Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) February 22, 2018\n\nSeveral governors, one of the latest being Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, have signed executive orders requiring the states only do business with ISPs that uphold the 2015 rules' standards.\n\nMore than half of the states have introduced legislation preventing ISPs from blocking and prioritizing content. Many mayors voiced opposition to an overturning of the 2015 rules, too. \"Local politicians are reading their coffee grounds and checking recent public polls, which show overwhelming bipartisan support for Net neutrality,\" said Timothy Carr, senior director of strategy and communications at Free Press, a consumer advocacy group, in a national look at the issue.\n\nLast week, Oregon became one of 26 states to introduce #NetNeutrality legislation. If you're an Oregonian, voice your approvalhttps://t.co/m5WKUBe0QB — EFF (@EFF) February 19, 2018\n\nFree Press also filed one of several preliminary lawsuits challenging the FCC's overturning of the 2015 rules. Now it and other parties including Mozilla, maker of Firefox browser, have begun re-filing their legal briefs with the new rules' official publication.\n\nWhether the states can be legally successful with their challenges remains to be seen, says Brent Skorup, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. But state attorneys general, along with the Federal Trade Commission, provide plenty of consumer protections under the new regulations, he says.\n\n\"This is a conflict of vision about the state and what the FCC should do. I expect the broad debate will continue,\" he said. \"It might not be called Net neutrality, but (it will address) what role should government have in this powerful new medium of the Internet.\"\n\nStill, a majority of Americans favor rules preventing ISPs from blocking content according to a nationally-representative survey conducted in September 2017 by Consumers Union, which supports a restoration of the 2015 rules. More than half (57%) supported the Net-neutrality rules, and 67% disagreed that providers should be able to choose what content customers can access.\n\nNow that the rules have been published, said Consumers Union senior policy counsel Jonathan Schwantes, \"we urge senators to listen to the consumers they represent and vote to restore these critical Net-neutrality rules to ensure that Internet service providers aren’t the gatekeepers to the Internet.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2or0VvI</p>",

As Pai chuckled, Schneider ceded the podium to Carolyn Meadows, the second vice president of the National Rifle Association. And Meadows presented Pai with the “Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award,” an honor that the NRA occasionally bestows on those who champion conservative causes despite intense criticism. Previous awardees include Vice President Pence and conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh.\n\nIn this case, the award was a “Kentucky handmade long gun,” said Meadows, who admitted the rifle could not be brought on stage. She said it would be stored for Pai at an NRA museum.\n\nConservative leaders explained they were honoring Pai partly because of his work to roll back federal rules that had subjected Internet providers to tougher regulations. The fight over net neutrality has resulted in Pai receiving death threats, forcing him to cancel recent public speeches.\n\nThe award came in the same week that the NRA’s leader appeared on stage at CPAC and blasted emerging federal efforts to restrict gun sales in the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla.\n\nPai appeared stunned. (His spokesman said that the FCC chairman had no idea he would receive such an award.) He soon joined a panel to discuss telecom policy along with his fellow Republican commissioners, including Michael O’Rielly, who quipped: “Not every day you get a musket.”\n\nO’Rielly, though, later found himself embroiled in his own controversy. His trouble started with a question about what the FCC could do to stop the constant “ping-pong” of issues, like net neutrality, every time the party in power changes in the nation’s capital.\n\n“I think what we can do is make sure as conservatives that we elect good people to both the House, Senate and make sure that President Trump gets reelected,” O’Rielly began.\n\nThe GOP commissioner’s plug for the president riled some ethics watchdogs. Under a set of rules known as the Hatch Act, government officials like O’Rielly generally aren’t supposed to use their stations to advocate for election outcomes.\n\nTechnically, Trump is already a candidate for the 2020 presidential race; he has filed his paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. The early nature of his candidacy even prompted the Office of Special Counsel to issue guidance in February 2017 as to what Trump administration officials could and could not say about their boss’s upcoming campaign. In short, the OSC ruled that the Hatch Act does “prohibit federal employees, while on duty or in the workplace, from expressly advocating for or against his reelection in 2020.”\n\nCiting that guidance, one organization — American Oversight, a nonprofit group backed by many Democrats that seeks to target the Trump administration on ethics issues — said it would file a complaint against O’Rielly with the OSC. Its leader, Austin Evers, also called in a statement for O’Rielly to resign.\n\nAnother watchdog — Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW — said it’s reviewing the matter. “This certainly raises Hatch Act issues,” spokesman Jordan Libowitz said in a statement. “[O’Rielly] is prohibited from taking part in partisan political activity using his official title or position.”\n\nIn response, a spokeswoman for O’Rielly said in a statement Friday: “Commissioner O’Rielly was asked a question on how to prevent the agency from ping ponging back and forth. He tried to respond in a factual way without engaging in advocacy.”\n\nTaken together, the Republicans’ appearance at a major conservative conference may serve to rekindle a persistent debate as to whether the agency has become too partisan — especially under Trump.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have openly questioned whether Pai and his colleagues at the FCC, an independent regulatory agency, have been influenced by Trump — and whether they’ve been too generous to the president’s political allies, including Sinclair, a broadcasting giant that’s currently seeking the agency’s approval to purchase Tribune Media. Pai repeatedly and forcefully has denied those charges.\n\n“The FCC controls our airwaves, the Internet, and so many of the things we interact with every single day,” said Evers, the executive director of American Oversight. “It should be independent, it should not be partisan, and bottom line, it should obey the law.”</p>",

Wochit\n\nWashington is the first state to pass its own laws governing net neutrality, with federal regulations preventing Internet service providers from blocking or throttling content slated to end in April.\n\n\"We know that when D.C. fails to act, Washington state has to do so,\" Gov. Jay Inslee said before signing the measure, the Associated Press reported. \"We know how important this is.\"\n\nOn Monday, Inslee signed the law protecting net neutrality rules within the state. The new legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, cements into state law the rules set by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015.\n\nThe FCC's rules prohibit ISPs from blocking legal content, throttling traffic or prioritizing content on their broadband networks.\n\n\"Today we make history: Washington will be the first state in the nation to preserve the open internet,\" Inslee said during a bill signing ceremony. Washington's law will take effect June 6; however, the FCC's changes to its rules go into effect next month.\n\nThree months ago, the FCC repealed the 2015 rules preventing ISPs from favoring content on its networks. Chairman Ajit Pai has said the rules were too intrusive.\n\nISPs including AT&T and Comcast have said they won't block or throttle legal websites with the relaxed rules, but left open the possibility of charging more for some content.\n\nWashington is among several states exploring protections for net neutrality in the wake of the FCC's repeal.\n\nLast month, the Oregon House of Representatives passed a bill requiring state and local government to only acquire broadband access from companies complying with net neutrality standards.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, governors in Hawaii, Montana, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont have signed executive orders tied to net neutrality.\n\nTwenty-two states and the District of Columbia, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, filed a suit federal court in Washington, D.C. last month challenging the FCC's new rules.\n\nAs of last month, legislators in 26 states have introduced 59 bills in support of net neutrality rules.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2I7eIjV</p>",

                  "headline": "GOP congressman alleges McCabe lied to Comey, exposing apparent rift between FBI officials",
                  "text": "<p>The FBI’s disciplinary office found that ousted deputy director Andrew McCabe lied to his boss, then-director James B. Comey, in October 2016 about having authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter, a Republican congressman whose office reviewed the findings alleged Friday.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in an interview that McCabe lied to Comey when Comey asked him how sensitive information ended up in an October 2016 Wall Street Journal story detailing internal tension at the FBI and Justice Department over an investigation into matters surrounding the Clinton Foundation. Jordan’s staffers, along with staffers for Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, were permitted this week to view a report on McCabe from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Jordan said.\n\nNeither Meadows nor his spokesman responded to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to Jordan, the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility determined that McCabe lied to his superiors and investigators four times: to Comey in October 2016; to FBI investigators in May 2017; and to the Office of the Inspector General twice, beginning in the summer.\n\nIn a statement, McCabe’s attorney said it was fully appropriate for the bureau’s deputy director to authorize media interaction and asserted that Comey knew about it. The attorney, Michael R. Bromwich, said emails between the two men “clearly show that Mr. McCabe advised Director Comey that he was working with colleagues at the FBI to correct inaccuracies before the stories were published, and that they remained in contact through the weekend while the interactions with the reporter continued.”\n\n“We deeply regret being compelled to respond to this selective leaking with any comment at all,” Bromwich said, accusing Republicans of “attempting to create a false narrative” that pits Comey and McCabe against each other.\n\n“Nevertheless, one thing is clear: Mr. McCabe never misled Director Comey. Director Comey’s memory of these interactions was equivocal and speculative, while Mr. McCabe’s recollection is clear, unequivocal and supported by documentary evidence,” Bromwich continued. “Director Comey has no specific recollection of what Mr. McCabe told him, while Mr. McCabe remembers the two discussed the article before and after its publication.”\n\nAn attorney for Comey declined to comment.\n\nThe revelation sheds new light on a matter of keen interest to Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is investigating how the bureau handled its probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The inquiry, once complete, is expected to determine that McCabe authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to reporter Devlin Barrett, then of the Wall Street Journal. Barrett now works for The Washington Post.\n\nComey asked McCabe about the source of the information in Barrett’s article shortly after it was published, Jordan said.\n\nTwo days before the article was published, Comey notified congressional leaders that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s emails.\n\nOn Thursday, McCabe launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his legal defense. As of Friday afternoon, he had raised almost $450,000. It is unclear whether McCabe will be charged with wrongdoing.\n\nRelying on the inspector general’s findings, the FBI’s disciplinary office recommended in its report that McCabe should be fired for the media disclosures and for allegedly misleading investigators and Comey about his role in authorizing them. The disciplinary office did not weigh in on whether McCabe should face criminal liability for his actions, according to Jordan.\n\nMcCabe, who has been a frequent target of criticism from President Trump, has said his firing was politically motivated and disputes he misled anyone.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions terminated McCabe’s employment this month, about 26 hours before he would have been able to claim a full pension for an FBI career of more than two decades.\n\nSeveral members of the GOP have asked Sessions to appoint a second special counsel to examine the FBI’s conduct during the Clinton email investigation and in applying for a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\nThe inspector general announced this week that his office would examine the warrant application, too . Republicans argue the inspector general lacks the reach necessary to examine the matter fully.\n\nSessions has effectively dismissed calls for a second special counsel, announcing Thursday that U.S. attorney John W. Huber of Utah would spearhead a broader review and saying that a second special counsel was warranted only in “extraordinary circumstances.”\n\nJordan surmised that, eventually, Sessions would be compelled to appoint a second special counsel, saying questions about the FBI’s conduct had already caused firings of the FBI’s director and deputy director and affected the careers of several top FBI officials. “If that’s not extraordinary circumstances, I don’t know what is,” Jordan said.\n\nEllen Nakashima contributed to this report.</p>",

                  "headline": "FCC blocks reveal of emails with conservative news site about net neutrality video",
                  "text": "<p>In December, the day before the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal its net neutrality rules, the agency’s chairman, Ajit Pai, appeared in a video for conservative news website The Daily Caller.\n\nThe video was a riff on the “Harlem Shake” videos that had become popular on the internet, and showed Pai downplaying the impact that undoing net neutrality rules would have on the internet and people's’ lives.\n\nBecause many people were surprised to see a high-ranking government policymaker explaining the new internet rules while dancing and waving a light saber, or wearing a Santa suit and sunglasses, the video raced across the internet, and has racked up more than 1.4 million views since it was published on YouTube.\n\nThe origins of the video, however, weren’t entirely clear. Whose idea was it? Who wrote the script? Did the other FCC commissioners know about it? So Muckrock, a nonprofit organization that helps request and analyze government documents, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FCC four months ago for agency emails about the video, a request that would seem relatively innocuous.\n\nThe request was denied this week. The organization is now appealing the denial and considering a lawsuit.\n\n“The very basic fact that they’re unwilling to even disclose whether anybody had objections to this internally, or if they were all aboard, is the larger problem,” said J. Pat Brown, the executive editor of Muckrock. “You are entitled answers out of your government.”\n\nThe FCC declined to comment.\n\nMuckrock’s FOIA denial is one of many from the FCC, which has come under fire from watchdog groups and activists for a lack of transparency. The regulatory agency already faces one lawsuit for not responding to FOIA requests. Jason Prechtel, a freelance writer, filed the suit in hopes of getting access to information about comments filed in response to the agency’s proposal to repeal net neutrality rules.\n\n“After all, how are we supposed to trust in the integrity of the FCC’s decision-making process when they won’t divulge records showing how millions of comments that are already public were submitted to begin with, and by who?” Prechtel wrote.\n\nPrechtel’s lawyer, Josh Burday, told NBC News he saw similarities in Prechtel’s denied FOIA request and Muckrock’s rejection.\n\n\"It's no surprise that the FCC is continuing to deny FOIA requests like the 'Harlem Shake' request in an effort to keep everything related to the controversial repeal of net neutrality secret,” Burday said. “The FCC failed to so much as respond to our client's request regarding the net neutrality comment process until after we filed suit. When the FCC finally did respond it essentially denied the request in its entirety.\"\n\nPai has been the focal point for much of the criticism aimed at the agency, given his earlier promises of openness.\n\n“One of my priorities as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will be to make the agency’s operations more transparent,” Pai wrote in an official statement released Feb. 2, 2017. “I want us to do a better job of communicating with those we are here to serve.”\n\nThe tech news website Gizmodo was similarly rejected in its records request for information involving a video in which Pai jokingly referred to himself as a “Verizon shill,” which was played at the Federal Communications Bar Association meeting on Dec. 8, 2017.\n\n“There are two embarrassing videos Ajit Pai is directly related to that the FCC doesn’t want to reveal any information about,” Brown said. “I wonder if they think these emails will harm the agency’s ability to make more embarrassing videos in the future.”\n\nCritiques of the FCC’s lack of transparency have also come from the agency’s own commissioners. Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the two Democratic commissioners on the FCC, has noted that the agency did not hold any public hearings concerning its plans to undo net neutrality rules.\n\n“While I fundamentally disagree with the merits of the FCC’s proposal, what is equally concerning is the lack of integrity to the FCC’s process that has led to this point,” she wrote in a statement a week before the FCC net neutrality vote.\n\nGigi Sohn, a former counselor at the FCC and currently a fellow at Georgetown University's law school, said that Pai hasn't lived up to his promise of transparency.\n\n\"While the Chairman likes to boast about how transparent his FCC is, there appears to be very little transparency about his meetings with industry and right-leaning organizations,\" Sohn wrote in an email.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's allies are preparing an extensive campaign to fight back against James Comey's publicity tour, trying to undermine the credibility of the former FBI director by reviving the blistering Democratic criticism of him before he was fired nearly a year ago.\n\nThe battle plan against Comey, obtained by CNN, calls for branding the nation's former top law enforcement official as \"Lyin' Comey\" through a website , digital advertising and talking points to be sent to Republicans across the country before his memoir is released next week. The White House signed off on the plan, which is being overseen by the Republican National Committee.\n\n\"Comey is a liar and a leaker and his misconduct led both Republicans and Democrats to call for his firing,\" Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CNN. \"If Comey wants the spotlight back on him, we'll make sure the American people understand why he has no one but himself to blame for his complete lack of credibility.\"\n\nWhile it's an open question how successful Republicans will be in making their case against Comey, given that Trump unceremoniously dismissed him last May 9, there is no doubt that many Democrats remain furious at how the former FBI director treated Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nRepublicans hope to remind Democrats why they disliked Comey by assailing his credibility, shining a new light on his conduct and pointing out his contradictions -- or the three Cs.\n\nAn old quotation from Clinton is prominently displayed on the \"Lyin'Comey\" website, with Trump's former Democratic rival saying that Comey \"badly overstepped his bounds.\"\n\nComey's media blitz\n\nThe Comey memoir, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" is set to be released next Tuesday. His media blitz begins Sunday evening in an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, who says Comey compared Trump to a \" mob boss .\"\n\nThe President's firing of Comey set into motion a cascading series of events that continue to complicate and cloud the Trump presidency. The Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel in the Russia probe after it was revealed that Trump had asked Comey to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nThe White House is bracing for Comey to share his story, with aides fearful of how the President will react and how it could influence the escalating Mueller investigation. The well-orchestrated RNC strategy could, of course, be upended by the President himself through a tweet or off-the-cuff comments about Comey.\n\nThe exhaustive plan to attack Comey illustrates how seriously Trump's allies are taking the memoir and a round of television interviews Comey is set to give, including on CNN starting next week followed by a town hall April 25.\n\nThe Republican plan against Comey is built around several aggressive arguments, according to the plan obtained by CNN, including these:\n\n1) \"Comey has a long history of misstatements and misconduct,\" including damage caused to the FBI because of \"bizarre decisions, contradictory statements and acting against Department of Justice and FBI protocol.\"\n\n2) \"Attempts to smear the Trump administration are nothing more than retaliation by a disgraced former official.\"\n\n3) \"Comey isn't credible -- just ask Democrats.\" The digital ads will show several Democrats calling for Comey's resignation after he injected himself into the 2016 presidential race, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who is shown saying: \"All I can tell you is the FBI Director has no credibility.\"\n\nPolitical contradictions\n\nThe political contradictions surrounding Comey are underscored by how such a central part of the Republican plan is built around reminding Americans of how Democrats had disdain for him, particularly those from the Clinton campaign. Republicans will argue that Comey \"repeatedly usurped\" the authority of then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and violated protocol by \"publicly acknowledging the existence of ongoing FBI investigations.\"\n\nThe Republican plan also takes a closer look at Comey's appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee last June, when he testified that the President had asked him to stop investigating Flynn. That contradicted a remark he made earlier when testifying that the President did not ask him to stop an investigation for political reasons.\n\nFor Comey, who once enjoyed wide bipartisan support in Washington, the book tour comes with high stakes. A former deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead the FBI in 2013.\n\nSince Trump dismissed Comey during the fourth year of a 10-year term he has remained largely silent, with the exception of testifying last summer on Capitol Hill and a handful of searing tweets aimed at the President. The memoir's release is the first major opportunity for Comey to speak aloud -- and be subjected to questions -- about his interaction with Trump before being fired.\n\n\"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\" Comey wrote last month on Twitter. \"And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\n\nThe RNC plan, which was approved by the White House, attempts to portray Comey as a man simply out for himself.\n\n\"James Comey's publicity tour is a self-serving attempt to make money and rehabilitate his own image,\" said McDaniel, the RNC chairwoman.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>In advance of a publicity tour by James B. Comey to promote his new book, the Republican National Committee is preparing a widespread campaign to undercut his credibility, including a new website that dubs the former FBI director as “Lyin’ Comey.”\n\nThe website prominently features quotes from Democrats highly critical of Comey before his firing by Trump nearly a year ago as the president grew agitated by the Russia probe.\n\nRNC officials say their effort will also include digital ads, a “war room” to monitor Comey’s television appearances, a rapid response team to rebut his claims in real time and coordination of Trump surrogates to fan out across other TV programs.\n\nThe broadside against Comey — a registered Republican for most of his adult life — comes as he set to begin a media tour to tout his memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” which is expected to be brutally critical of Trump.\n\nIn advance of the book’s release next Tuesday, Comey is scheduled to appear in an interview airing Sunday night with ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos. A teaser for the interview says Comey compares Trump to a “mob boss.”\n\nPresident Trump on April 9 said he did “the right thing” when he fired James B. Comey as FBI director last year. (The Washington Post)\n\nIn the book, Comey writes that when he was fired by Trump in May 2017, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly called him in an “emotional” state and said he was “sick” over the ouster. Kelly told Comey that he “intended to quit” because he “didn’t want to work for dishonorable people,” according to Comey’s account.\n\nComey recalls urging Kelly to stay in his job, which he did, arguing that “this president” especially needed principled public servants in his administration.\n\nThe Kelly scene was first reported Thursday by The Daily Beast and confirmed to The Washington Post by someone who has read Comey’s book.\n\nComey’s memoir could damage the reputations of Trump and some of his top aides, and the president’s allies are scrambling to undercut Comey’s account.\n\nIn a statement, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, “James Comey’s publicity tour is a self-serving attempt to make money and rehabilitate his own image. If Comey wants the spotlight back on him, we’ll make sure the American people understand why he has no one but himself to blame for his complete lack of credibility.”\n\nThe RNC effort underscores the in­cred­ibly high stakes for Trump and his party as Comey details his interactions with the president, including his claim that Trump asked for a loyalty test. Many Democrats, meanwhile, are hopeful that new revelations will further bolster a case for the president’s impeachment.\n\nComey’s firing set off a chain of events that have endangered Trump’s presidency. The Justice Department appointed Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election — and possible collusion with the Trump campaign — in the aftermath of Comey’s ouster.\n\nWith the Mueller probe escalating — including the FBI raid this week of Trump’s personal lawyer’s home and office in Manhattan — Comey’s media appearances could pose a major public relations challenge for the White House.\n\n“I’ve been around politics a long time, and I know fear when I see it,” said Jim Manley, a lobbyist and former senior aide to former Senate minority leader Harry M. Reid. “This White House reeks of fear. ... This shows me that they are prepared to use a scorched-earth strategy to undermine the FBI’s credibility. The party of law and order has become the party of trying to protect Trump at all costs.”\n\nDoug Heye, a former RNC communications director, said the Republican effort shows Comey’s publicity tour is “going to dominate news coverage. He’s going to seemingly everywhere.”\n\nBut Heye said the RNC is doing its job. “It would be political malpractice not to do this,” he said.\n\nHeye said the biggest challenge for Republicans could be combatting claims from Comey that have not previously made headlines.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has continued to attack Comey on Twitter, and Comey has suggested he will have his say through his book.\n\n“Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not,” Comey said in a tweet last month.\n\nEarlier this week, Comey tweeted a picture of the room in his home where he was interviewed by Stephanopoulos, which had been transformed into a small television studio.\n\n“Not how my house normally looks,” Comey wrote. “One chair for George, one for me.”\n\nAs part of its effort, the RNC is also distributing talking points to Trump surrogates to further its case against Comey. Among them: “Comey is a consummate Washington insider who knows how to work the media to protect his flanks” and “Americans will remember that his attempts to smear the Trump administration are nothing more than retaliation by a disgraced former official.”\n\nThough Comey was a registered Republican for most of his adult life, he has said he no longer is. He was appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and deputy attorney general by President George W. Bush; he was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama.\n\nFollowing Sunday’s interview, Comey has numerous other bookings, including news programs as well as appearances with CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert and the hosts of “The View.”\n\nA large reception is also planned on Tuesday, the day of the book release, at the Newseum in Washington.\n\nAmong those quoted on the RNC website is the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, who argued her campaign was seriously undercut by the FBI’s investigation, overseen by Comey, into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. “Badly overstepped his bounds,” Clinton is quoted as saying of Comey.\n\nOther Democrats whose past quotes are included on the website include Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) (“I do not have confidence in [Comey] any longer”), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) (“The FBI director has no credibility.”) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (“It would not be a bad thing for the American people if [Comey] did step down.”).\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report.</p>",

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Former FBI Director James Comey blasts President Donald Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth\" and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty\" in a forthcoming book.\n\nComey reveals new details about his interactions with Trump and his own decision-making in handling the Hillary Clinton email investigation before the 2016 election. He casts Trump as a mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nThe book adheres closely to Comey's public testimony and written statements about his contacts with the president during the early days of the administration and his growing concern about the president's integrity. It also includes strikingly personal jabs at Trump that appear likely to irritate the president.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Comey describes Trump as shorter than he expected with a \"too long\" tie and \"bright white half-moons\" under his eyes that he suggests came from tanning goggles. He also says he made a conscious effort to check the president's hand size, saying it was \"smaller than mine, but did not seem unusually so.\"\n\nThe book, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" is to be released next week. The Associated Press purchased a copy this week.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a scramble at the Justice Department that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has assailed Comey as a \"showboat\" and a \"liar.\"\n\nComey's account lands at a particularly sensitive moment for Trump and the White House. Officials there describe Trump as enraged over a recent FBI raid of his personal lawyer's home and office, raising the prospect that he could fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, or try to shut down the probe on his own. The Republican National Committee is poised to lead the pushback effort against Comey, who is set to do a series of interviews to promote the book, by launching a website and supplying surrogates with talking points that question the former director's credibility.\n\nTrump has said he fired Comey because of his handling of the FBI's investigation into his Clinton's email practices. Trump used the investigation as a cudgel in the campaign and repeatedly said Clinton should be jailed for using a personal email system while serving as secretary of state. Democrats, on the other hand, have accused Comey of politicizing the investigation, and Clinton herself has said it hurt her election prospects.\n\nComey writes that he regrets his approach and some of the wording he used in his July 2016 press conference in which he announced the decision not to prosecute Clinton. But he says he believes he did the right thing by going before the cameras and making his statement, noting that the Justice Department had done so in other high profile cases.\n\nEvery person on the investigative team, Comey writes, found that there was no prosecutable case against Clinton and that the FBI didn't find that she lied under its questioning.\n\nHe also reveals for the first time that the U.S. government had unverified classified information that he believes could have been used to cast doubt on Attorney General Loretta Lynch's independence in the Clinton probe. While Comey does not outline the details of the information — and says he didn't see indications of Lynch inappropriately influencing the investigation — he says it worried him that the material could be used to attack the integrity of the probe and the FBI's independence.\n\nComey's book will be heavily scrutinized by the president's legal team looking for any inconsistencies between it and his public testimony, under oath, before Congress. They will be looking to impeach Comey's credibility as a key witness in Mueller's obstruction investigation, which the president has cast as a political motivated witch hunt.\n\nHe provides new details of his firing. He writes that then-Homeland Security secretary John Kelly — now Trump's chief of staff — offered to quit out of a sense of disgust as to how Comey was dismissed, as well as his first encounter with Trump, a January 2017 briefing at Trump Tower in New York City. Kelly has been increasingly marginalized in the White House and the president has mused to confidantes about firing the chief of staff.\n\nComey also writes extensively about his first meeting with Trump after his election. Others in the meeting included Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Michael Flynn, who would become national security adviser, and incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer. Comey was also joined by NSA Director Mike Rogers, CIA Director John Brennan and DNI Director James Clapper.\n\nAfter Clapper briefed the team on the intelligence community's findings of Russian election interference, Comey said he was taken aback by what the Trump team didn't ask.\n\n\"They were about to lead a country that had been attacked by a foreign adversary, yet they had no questions about what the future Russian threat might be,\" Comey writes. Instead, he writes, they launched into a strategy session about how to \"spin what we'd just told them\" for the public.\n\n__\n\nLemire reported from New York.</p>",

                  "headline": "Comey book claims President Trump sought loyalty like mafia boss 'Sammy the Bull'",
                  "text": "<p>Donald Trump engaged in a months-long effort to secure the loyalty of then-FBI Director James Comey in a series of meetings and phone calls that began in the presidential transition period -- behavior Comey likens to that of a mafia boss, Comey writes in a book set for release next week.\n\nThose efforts included a now-famous, private White House dinner with Trump just a week after the president was inaugurated, in which Trump, Comey writes, told him: “I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.”\n\nComey writes that to him, “The demand was like Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony,” referring to Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano, a former leader of the Gambino crime family, whose testimony ultimately helped convict mob boss John Gotti.\n\nComey responded with silence, he writes in the book, and Trump moved the conversation along. Later in the dinner, Trump returned to the subject: “I need loyalty.”\n\n“You will always get honesty from me,” Comey writes that he responded.\n\n“That’s what I want, honest loyalty,” Trump said.\n\n“You will get that from me,” Comey responded.\n\nThe book, “A Higher Loyalty,” is Comey’s first extensive public accounting of his handling of investigations affecting Trump and Hillary Clinton – and the circumstances around his firing by Trump – since his congressional testimony last year.\n\nA few weeks before his private dinner with the president, shortly before his inauguration, Comey had a similar feeling about mob loyalty pledges during his first meeting with Trump, he writes. Comey and other top intelligence officials were at Trump Tower to brief the president-elect, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and a small circle of their top aides on Russian efforts to influence the election.\n\nRather than ask about how to meet the threat from Russia, Comey writes, Trump, Pence and incoming White House aides Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer quickly focused on “how they could spin what we’d just told them,” debating “how to position these findings for maximum political advantage.”\n\n“I sat there thinking, Holy crap, they are trying to make each of us ‘amica nostra’ – friend of ours. To draw us in,” Comey writes. “As crazy as it sounds, I suddenly had the feeling that, in the blink of an eye, the president-elect was trying to make us all part of the same family and that Team Trump had made it a ‘thing of ours.’”\n\nWeeks later, after the private dinner with Trump in which Comey says he agreed to give the president “honest loyalty,” Comey had another private Oval Office meeting with Trump. This time, he writes, Trump appeared to ask him to drop an FBI inquiry of fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\n“He is a good guy,” Trump told Comey, according to the book. “I hope you can let this go.”\n\n“I did not interrupt the president to protest that what he was asking was inappropriate, as I probably should have,” Comey writes. “But if he didn’t know what he was doing was inappropriate, why had he just ejected everyone, including my boss [Attorney General Jeff Sessions] and the vice president, from the room so he could speak with me alone?”\n\nThe book also includes a detailed description of Comey’s handling of the investigation regarding Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. That investigation led Comey to make a series of unusual and controversial public statements over the course of the summer and fall of 2016 – statements Clinton and others believe influenced the election.\n\nComey writes that he felt obligated to take more of a personal role as the public face of the investigation rather than deferring to then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch – in part because of something involving Lynch that he cryptically refers to as a “development still unknown to the American public to this day.”\n\nIn early 2016, the U.S. government became aware of information from a classified source, and “the source and content of that material remains classified as I write this,” according to the book.\n\n“Had it become public, the unverified material would undoubtedly have been used by political opponents to cast serious doubt on the attorney general’s independence in connection with the Clinton investigation,” Comey writes, without further elaboration.\n\nComey asserts that he didn’t sense Lynch interfered with the investigation, even after the highly publicized Phoenix tarmac meeting between Lynch and former President Bill Clinton. That episode convinced Comey that he needed to step forward with his own public accounting of the email server investigation.\n\nIn an interview with NBC this week, in advance of the book’s publication, Lynch said she and Comey had a “full and open discussion” about the handling of the Clinton email case in the fall of 2015, and that “concerns were not raised.”\n\nComey maintains he handled the initial public statements around the Clinton investigation correctly, save for two small changes he would make in hindsight regarding how he described his decision not to pursue criminal charges in July 2016.\n\nComey writes that he should have said at the outset of his public statement that there would be no charges; his family, he writes, believed he was “Seacresting” – or building up a dramatic tease like television host Ryan Seacrest.\n\nHe also writes that he should not have used the term “extremely careless” to describe Clinton’s behavior, since it sounded roughly similar to “grossly negligent” – the legal standard for prosecution.\n\nComey reveals that he was first told in early October 2016 that a laptop belonging to former Rep. Anthony Weiner “might have some connection to the Clinton email case.” He said he believes Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe – who himself would be fired by Trump earlier this year – told him about it.\n\nBut Comey writes that he didn’t think much of it until Oct. 27, 2016, when McCabe said the Clinton email team needed to update him on what they were learning.\n\nThat led to a highly unusual series of public statements by Comey in the final two weeks before the election. He first announced the laptop might have relevant information and was being examined, and then said on the weekend before Election Day that nothing relevant was found in it.\n\n“I have read she has felt anger toward me personally, and I’m sorry for that,” Comey writes, referring to Clinton. “I’m sorry that I couldn’t do a better job explaining to her and her supporters why I made the decisions I made.”\n\nHe adds that, shortly after the election, then-President Barack Obama personally offered his support for how he handled the job in an Oval Office meeting.\n\n“I picked you to be FBI director because of your integrity and your ability,” Obama said, according to Comey. “I want you to know that nothing – nothing – has happened in the last year to change my view.”\n\nStill, Comey writes that his public handling of the Clinton case – specifically, of providing more information to the public rather than less – may have been influenced by the widespread assumption that Trump would lose the election.\n\n“Certainly not consciously, but I would be a fool to say it couldn’t have had an impact on me,” he writes.\n\n“It is entirely possible,” he continues, that “my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I don’t know.”\n\nThe mindset that Clinton would win despite Russian involvement may have impacted Obama’s own handling of developments late in the campaign, according to Comey. When deliberating how to respond to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s apparent election meddling in September, Comey recalls Obama opting for fewer public warnings, and saying of Putin, “He backed the wrong horse.”\n\nComey surmises of Obama’s mindset: “And why give Donald Trump the excuse to blame Obama for frightening the American people? He was going to lose anyway.”\n\nComey, however, makes clear his affection for Obama – and his disdain for Trump and his leadership style. Though he did not vote in 2016, and secured his first high-profile government jobs under the Republican presidency of George W. Bush, he writes that his wife and daughters voted for Clinton and even participated in the Women’s March, held the day after the inauguration in Washington.\n\nThe book is peppered with unflattering personal observations about Trump. Comey, who is 6’8”, writes that Trump “appeared shorter than he seemed on a debate stage,” and says of the hand he offered for a handshake, “It was smaller than mine, but did not seem unusually so.”\n\nWriting of their first meeting, in Trump Tower, Comey says the president-elect’s “face appeared slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coiffed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his. I remember wondering how long it must take him in the morning to get that done.”\n\nWeeks later, as he recounts Trump’s apparent effort to pull him in for a hug while cameras rolled at a White House reception for law enforcement, Comey writes, “He was not going to get a hug without being a whole lot stronger than he looked. He wasn’t.”\n\nAt one point, Comey describes Trump’s manner of speaking as “an oral jigsaw puzzle contest, with a shot clock.”\n\nComey’s firing shook Washington. He recounts receiving an “emotional call” from John Kelly, then Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security and his current chief of staff, in the chaotic hours after Comey learned – first via TV news reports – that he had been fired.\n\nIn Comey’s telling, Kelly told him that he “intended to quit in protest” because “he didn’t want to work for dishonorable people who would treat someone like me in such a manner,” in an account that confirms reporting that first emerged last summer.\n\n“I urged Kelly not to do that, arguing that the country needed principled people around this president. Especially this president,” Comey writes.\n\nComey concedes, as he did before Congress last year, that he sought to get information out to the public about his interactions with the president by asking a friend to describe memos he had dictated about his conversations with Trump. He writes that he did so only because Trump seemed to threaten him with a tweet suggesting there might be “tapes” of those conversations.\n\nComey writes that he revealed the February 2017 conversation during which he claims the president urged him drop an investigation of Flynn because “I didn’t trust the Department of Justice leadership under the current attorney general and deputy attorney general to do the right thing,” in pursuing possible tapes.\n\nComey’s claim that Trump urged him to “let it go” regarding the Flynn “might force the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor,” Comey writes.\n\nThat happened shortly thereafter, with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation remains active. While Mueller intersects with Comey’s story throughout the book, especially during their years serving the Bush administration, Comey writes that he has no knowledge of what he’s pursuing. But he does have some theories.\n\n“One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Mueller’s team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime,” Comey writes. “It’s certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble.”\n\nComey repeatedly expresses concern that the president is harming democratic institutions. In his epilogue, he refers to “the forest fire that is the Trump presidency.”</p>",

                  "text": "<p>Net neutrality is dead. Long live net neutrality.\n\nThe long-time hot-button issue — essentially about whether your Internet service provider should be able to block or slow legal traffic, or charge for faster delivery of some content — won't likely recede any time soon, even though a milestone nears in the national tussle about the topic.\n\nSome states are also considering laws preventing Internet service providers from blocking and throttling content on consumers' broadband connections, even though they're likely to face court challenges from opponents who argue that the new federal rules prevent states from passing their own.\n\nCalifornia's state judiciary committee will hear one such bill next week.\n\n\"In California, we can lead the effort to clean up this mess and implement comprehensive, thorough Internet protections that put California Internet users and consumers first,\" said state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, who sponsored the bill, in a statement.\n\nOregon has already passed its own. Gov. Kate Brown last week signed into law a measure requiring state agencies only to do business with ISPs that do not block or slow traffic or accept payment to prioritize some data.\n\n#ICYMI: Yesterday I signed Oregon's #NetNeutrality bill into law, to help ensure the internet remains open and accessible to all. What exactly does that mean? Watch here: https://t.co/m2OLdiziAR — Governor Kate Brown (@OregonGovBrown) April 10, 2018\n\nAttorneys general in 23 states and the District of Columbia have filed a suit seeking to prevent the rules change, calling it \"arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.\"\n\nAll of this activity suggests net neutrality could likely be an issue in the mid-term elections and perhaps even in the 2020 campaign cycle.\n\nIf so, that could be good news for politicians hoping to draft on the issue. Most citizens (86%) support net neutrality, as defined by the 2015 rules, according to a new survey, released Wednesday by the nonpartisan group Voice of the People, and conducted by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland. It surveyed 997 registered voters in March.\n\nSupport for net neutrality crosses party lines among voters with 90% of Democrats in favor and 82% of Republicans, the survey found. Support from Republicans has risen from 75% when a similar survey was conducted in December 2017.\n\nThat means a growing populace wants \"the Internet to work the way it's always worked,\" said Phillip Berenbroick, senior policy counsel for Public Knowledge, a non-profit group has filed suit challenging the Federal Communication Commission's December overturning of the 2015 rules. \"And you have got a minority of folks here in Washington that currently have access to levers of power that are in disagreement with more than 80% of the American public. ... It’s baffling.\"\n\nTelecom giants, which lobbied for the Obama-era rules' repeal, can also get legislators' attention. Since 1989, the telecom industry, led by AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, has donated more than $100 million to sitting members of Congress and their leadership PACs, 55% of that to Republicans, according to a report in The Verge.\n\nStill, in Congress some net neutrality-supporting lawmakers hold out hope for an immediate resolution: a Congressional Review Act measure to reinstate the 2015 rules. There's enough support already in the U.S. Senate for a vote, and it must be done by June 20.\n\nThe likelihood of the Congress Review Act measure's success is slim, however. In the U.S. House, 160 Democrats are already on board for a vote that needs 218 signatures. But a CRA measure must also be approved by President Trump, an unlikely event since he appointed Pai and called the Obama-era rules a \"power grab.\"\n\nTrump appointee Ajit Pai, Chairman of the FCC, has been shepherding through the repeal of the old rules and their replacement with the Restoring Internet Freedom order, a set of lighter-touch regulations. It was expected to officially take effect Monday but won't kick in for at least a few more weeks as it undergoes additional vetting by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nIn reality, the FCC has already shifted its stance. Within a month of being appointed by President Trump, Chairman Ajit Pai ended several net neutrality-related investigations started by his predecessor including the investigation of whether free data plans offered by wireless providers such as AT&T and Verizon violated the agency's regulations.\n\nThis has left the issue of net neutrality in the hands of states and courts. The legal action by the state attorneys general — along with suits filed by groups such as Free Press and National Hispanic Media Coalition, and companies including Mozilla, Etsy and Vimeo — will begin going through the judicial process in the coming months.\n\nAlso happening in the states: several governors have passed executive orders requiring ISPs doing business with the state follow net neutrality conduct.\n\nThese state initiatives could yield more court challenges, too. USTelecom, a trade group made of ISPs including AT&T and Verizon, has promised to sue to block net neutrality measures adopted by states such as Washington, the first to do so, \"to avoid a piecemeal, patchwork approach to the future of our internet,\" the group's CEO and president Jonathan Spalter said on the group's blog.\n\nBut legislation requires compromise and that has been elusive. Net neutrality supporters want rules that prevent ISPs from block and slowing content, and from charging for fast lanes. ISPs have publicly agreed not to do any of that, but they oppose heavy-handed regulations.\n\n\"Nobody really wants to have broadband providers to have unfettered control, but when it’s spun as governmental overreach all of a sudden people start viewing it differently,\" said Marc Martin, an attorney in the communications practice at Washington, D.C.-based law firm Perkins Coie, and a former FCC staffer.\n\nFederal Communication Commission Chairman Ajit Pai participates in a discussion about his accomplishments at The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research May 5, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)\n\nAnd there's the possibility that fast lanes, or \"paid prioritization\" of content may eventually become fair game. \"Prioritization is not a dirty word,\" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., during a House subcommittee hearing on the issue this week. \"We need a better understanding of what specific harmful conduct we are trying to address, and a better understanding of how to leave the door open for the beneficial prioritization that’s necessary to keep the Internet as we know it working, and to bring even more benefits to consumers.\"\n\nA possible solution: Within the federal legislation create an independent tribunal to weigh Internet issues including competition and privacy involving ISPs and dominant tech platforms such as Facebook and Google.\n\nSuch a tribunal beyond the FCC or Federal Trade Commission would solve concerns about each agencies' enforcement powers, says economist Hal Singer at Adjunct Professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, who has proposed the idea.\n\nAnd holding ISPs and big Internet players to similar standards would create a more equitable playing field, he says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2HB7Ei5</p>",

                  "text": "<p>WASHINGTON — In an unusual victory for Democrats, the Senate voted narrowly Wednesday to keep in place so-called “net neutrality” rules that prevent internet providers from blocking or slowing users’ access to certain websites and charging more for faster delivery of some content.\n\nSenators voted 52 to 47, mostly along party lines, to stop the Federal Communications Commission from repealing the rules that were put in place three years ago under former President Barack Obama. The repeal is scheduled to take effect on June 11.\n\nThree Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined all 49 Democrats in voting to keep the regulations in place.\n\nBut their quest to retain the rules may be short-lived. The measure now goes to the House, where it’s not certain GOP leaders will be willing to take it up. Evenif the legislation clears Congress, it still would have to be signed into law by President Trump, who has been critical of net neutrality.\n\nStill, Democrats argued that net neutrality is needed to make sure that all internet content is treated equally. Without it, they said, consumers could end up paying higher prices for slower service or even be stopped from accessing some of their favorite websites or apps.\n\n“This is our chance – our best chance – to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable for all Americans,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY.\n\n“Either we stand with everyday Americans or with the massive corporations who have found a new way to make money off of them,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\n\nRepublicans countered that the rules are heavy-handed and an example of government overregulation, and they accused Democrats of using the issue to fire up young voters ahead of this fall’s elections.\n\n“They know they won’t ultimately be successful, but they want to campaign on their desire to add new regulations to the internet,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n“This isn’t about serious legislating,” said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. “It’s about political theatre.”\n\nThe FCC, then chaired by Democrat Tom Wheeler, enacted the net neutrality rules in 2015 to prevent internet service providers from blocking or throttling legal content that users sought to access. The rules also prevented providers from charging users higher fees for providing faster delivery of some content.\n\nBy 2017, however, the FCC had a new chairman, Republican Ajit Pai, who had been appointed by Trump.\n\nUnder Pai’s leadership, the FCC voted 3-2, along party lines, last December to discard the rules and replace them with a light-touch set of regulations that do not prohibit internet service providers from blocking or speeding up access to sites or giving priority to their own content. If they do, however, they are required to disclose it.\n\nProviders have said they won't block or throttle legal websites but have left open the possibility that they might charge more for some data delivery.\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, sought to stop the FCC’s repeal of the Obama-era rules by using their authority under the Congressional Review Act to nullify the commission’s vote last December. Under the review act, just 30 senators were needed to force a vote on the measure, and all 49 Democrats backed Markey’s resolution.\n\nThe House, however, has a much higher threshold. A majority, or 218 votes, would be needed there to force a vote.\n\nThe FCC’s effort to halt net neutrality also is facing a legal challenge in some states. Twenty-three attorney’s general have filed a lawsuit to stop the repeal of the rules.\n\nMore: It's finally happening: Net neutrality rules that sparked intense debate to end next month\n\nMore: FCC Chair Ajit Pai defends net neutrality repeal to doubters at Mobile World Congress\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rNeY0o</p>",

Marginalised America | Carmen Scurato Read more\n\nThe rules bar internet service providers (ISPs) such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon from interfering with internet traffic by picking and choosing which types of data get sent quickly, and which types are either throttled or blocked. Without net neutrality rules in place, ISPs could discriminate against certain publishers and web services, while promoting others.\n\nNet neutrality has been championed by congressional Democrats, who hope that their support of an open internet will appeal to young voters. Three Republicans – Senators Susan Collins of Maine, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – broke with their party to support the measure.\n\nThe House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the vote a “victory for a grassroots”, while characterizing the FCC repeal as a “brazen giveaway at the expense of American families and citizens”.\n\nOpponents such as Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, said the Senate’s vote amounted to “political theater” with no prospects of approval by the GOP-controlled House.\n\nA similar resolution in the House, authored by Congressman Mike Doyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, has garnered 162 co-sponsors, all Democrats.\n\nAt a press conference following the Senate vote, Doyle announced that he would also open a discharge petition in an effort to force a vote on the issue. A discharge petition is a procedure to force a debate and vote on a bill despite the opposition of the speaker of the House. It requires signatures from a majority of the House, or 218 members.\n\nTelecommunications companies lobbied hard to overturn the 2015 rule, saying it discouraged investment and innovation. The FCC said in repealing it last December that it was simply restoring the “light-touch framework” that has governed the internet for most of its existence.\n\nThune urged Democrats to work with him on a plan that he said would incorporate the net neutrality principles they desire without onerous regulation that he said made it harder to connect more Americans to the internet and to upgrade service.\n\nHe said the internet thrived long before the Obama administration stepped in, and he predicted that when the Trump administration’s rule scrapping net neutrality goes into effect in June, consumers will not notice a change in service.\n\n“That’s what we’re going back to: rules that were in place for two decades under a light-touch regulatory approach that allowed the internet to explode and prosper and grow,” Thune said.\n\nDemocrats were undeterred. They see their effort as something that will energize young voters who value unfettered access to the internet.\n\n“This is our chance, our best chance to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable to all Americans,” said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader.</p>",

                  "text": "The U.S. Senate voted, largely along party lines, to protect Obama-era net neutrality rules threatened by the FCC, but the measure still needs to pass in the U.S. House. USA TODAY\n\nSenate Democrats approved a measure to quash the Federal Communications Commission's plan to overturn so-called net neutrality rules.\n\nBut major hurdles still face supporters of net neutrality, the principle that Internet Service Providers should give consumers access to all legal content and applications on an equal basis, not favoring some sources or blocking others.\n\nLike many other national issues, the subject is a partisan one. Democrats were able to prevail 52-47 in the Senate with all of their party on board, plus three Republicans — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine; Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.; and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala. (Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is undergoing cancer treatment in Arizona and is not in Washington, D.C., to vote.)\n\nHowever, the measure is unlikely to pass in the U.S. House and even if it were would have to be approved by President Trump.\n\nBack in December 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, appointed by President Trump in January 2017, shepherded the passage of the Restoring Internet Freedom order, which overturned net neutrality rules the agency had passed two years earlier when the commission was controlled by Democrats. Those Obama-era rules prevented Internet service providers from blocking or slowing legal traffic, or from being paid for prioritized, faster delivery.\n\nThe replacement rules, which go into effect next month, have a lighter-touch to enforcement. Internet service providers must disclose any blocking, throttling or prioritization of their own content or from their partners. However, they are not prevented from doing so, as did the 2015 rule.\n\nISPs have said they won't block or throttle legal websites, but have left open the potential for charging more for transport of some data.\n\nPai, the FCC chairman, expressed confidence the Democrats' effort would eventually fail. \"The Internet was free and open before 2015, when the prior FCC buckled to political pressure from the White House and imposed utility-style regulation on the Internet,\" he said in a statement. \"And it will continue to be free and open once the Restoring Internet Freedom Order takes effect on June 11.\"\n\nMore Tech: It's finally happening: Net neutrality rules that sparked intense debate to end next month\n\nCLOSE The Senate has voted to kill a Federal Communications Commission rule that repealed the Obama administration’s ban on internet providers blocking or slowing down certain content. Time\n\nBut net neutrality supporters prefer tougher rules over ISPs and Democrats in Congress opted to propose a Congressional Review Act vote to overturn the 2017 measure (the CRA is a quick way to nix newly-passed regulations within 60 legislative days of passage).\n\nBy forcing a public vote on the issue — one that's popular with voters — Democrats hope to hike pre-midterm election pressure on enough lawmakers to gain a majority in the House. Passage in the Senate would “send a clear message to American families that we support them, not the special interest agenda of President Trump and his broadband baron allies,\" said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who sponsored the CRA resolution.\n\nThe vote, he said, \"will be the most important vote for the Internet in the history of the Senate, and I call on my Republicans colleagues to join this movement and stand on the right side of digital history.”\n\nCollins said, in a statement, she voted for the measure to \"ensure that the Internet will remain open and continue to be a powerful and transformative platform of innovation and economic opportunity.\"\n\nShe supports \"bipartisan legislative reforms to the ... (The Communications Act of 1934) regulations that put consumers first.\"\n\nBut Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who on Wednesday attempted to have the CRA set aside and his own legislation draft considered, said in a statement, “This vote was about politics, not protecting net neutrality. Unfortunately, it’s only going to delay Senate Democrats from coming to the table and negotiating bipartisan net neutrality legislation.\"\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, many groups supported the CRA vote, among them several educational and research organizations.\n\n\"It's important that we continue to push forward even when we don’t like our political chances because this is a really critical issue,\" said Krista Cox, director of public policy initiatives for the Association of Research Libraries. \"A big part of this is continuing to support things we believe in but also raising awareness and ensuring that people are aware that Congress has the opportunity to act here.\"\n\nRep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., a member of the House subcommittee on communications, said he is filing a discharge petition seeking a vote on the issue in the House. \"We just need to get a majority of Representatives to sign it,\" he said. \"I’m sure that every Member of the House will want to know where their constituents stand on this issue.”\n\nHowever, the Democrats' deployment of the CRA may misfire since the law is meant to overturn regulations, not the the repeal of regulations, says Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation, a free-market think tank. \"It is unclear, as a matter of law, whether the CRA can repeal an 'order' as opposed to a 'rule',\" he said in a statement.\n\nShould the CRA actually pass, it could diminish privacy protections granted to the Federal Trade Commission in the 2017 order, May says. \"If Congress wants to weigh in on net neutrality, it should not act inaptly, but rather affirmatively to adopt a law clearly embodying the policies and practices it deems appropriate.”\n\nMore Tech: Net neutrality: The FCC voted to end it.
